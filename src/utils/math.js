/**
 * Maps a value in a first range to its equivalent in a second range
 * Ex.: 5 in the range [0,10] gives 60 in the range[40,80]
 *
 * NOTE: lower/upper bounds on the source range are detected automatically,
 * however the bounds on the target range are not altered (thus the target
 * range could be decreasing).
 * Ex1: 8 in the range [0, 10] gives 2 in the range [10, 0]
 * Ex2: also, 8 in the range [10, 0] gives 2 in the range [10, 0]
 *
 * NOTE: Input value is enforced to be bounded inside the source range
 * Ex1: -2 in the range [0, 10] is interpreted as 0 and thus gives 40 in [40,80]
 * Ex2: 19 in the range [0, 5] is interpreted as 5 and thus gives 80 in [40,80]
 *
 * @param {number} val the value in the source range
 * @param {number} min1 the lower bound of the source range
 * @param {number} max1 the upper bound of the source range
 * @param {number} min2 the lower bound of the target range
 * @param {number} max2 the upper bound of the target range
 * @return {number} the equivalent value in the target range
