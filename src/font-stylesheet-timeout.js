/**
 * While browsers put a timeout on font downloads (3s by default,
 * some less on slow connections), there is no such timeout for style
 * sheets. In the case of AMP external stylesheets are ONLY used to
 * download fonts, but browsers have no reasonable timeout for
 * stylesheets. Users may thus wait a long time for these to download
 * even though all they do is reference fonts.
 *
 * For that reasons this function identifies (or rather infers) font
 * stylesheets that have not downloaded within 1 second of the page
 * response starting and reinserts equivalent link tags  dynamically. This
 * removes their page-render-blocking nature and lets the doc render.
 *
 * 1 second was picked, because the font-stylesheets are typically
 * tiny. If a connection wasn't able to deliver them within 1s
 * of page load start, then it is unlikely that it will be able
 * to download the font itself within 3s.
