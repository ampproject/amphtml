 * This patches the native constructor so that the polyfill can capture the
 * fields in the form passed to the constructor. If `FormData#entries` needs a
 * polyfill, chances are there are no native methods to read the content of the
 * `FormData` after construction, so the only way to polyfill `entries` is to
 * patch the constructor (and the `append` method).
 *
 * For more details on this, see http://mdn.io/FormData.
 *
 * @param {Window} win The window with `FormData` being polyfilled. This will be
 *     bound to the window where the polyfill is installed so that callers can't
 *     supply this argument and would simply use `new FormData(form)`.
 * @param {!HTMLFormElement=} opt_form An HTML `<form>` element â€” when
 *     specified, the FormData object will be populated with the form's current
 *     keys/values using the name property of each element for the keys and
 *     their submitted value for the values. It will also encode file input
 *     content.
 * @note Subclassing `FormData` doesn't work in this case as the transpiler
 *     generates code that calls the super constructor directly using
 *     `Function.prototype.call`. WebKit (Safari) doesn't allow this and
 *     enforces that constructors be called with the `new` operator.
