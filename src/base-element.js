/**
 * Base class for all custom element implementations. Instead of inheriting
 * from Element this class has an Element. Among other things this allows
 * switching the element implementation when going from a stub to the full
 * implementation.
 *
 * The base class implements a set of lifecycle methods that are called by
 * the runtime as appropriate. These are mostly based on the custom element
 * lifecycle (See
 * http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/webcomponents/customelements/)
 * and adding AMP style late loading to the mix.
 *
 * The complete lifecycle of custom DOM element is:
