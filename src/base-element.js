/**
 * Base class for all custom element implementations. Instead of inheriting
 * from Element this class has an Element. Among other things this allows
 * switching the element implementation when going from a stub to the full
 * implementation.
 *
 * The base class implements a set of lifecycle methods that are called by
 * the runtime as appropriate. These are mostly based on the custom element
 * lifecycle (See
 * https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/getting-started/primers/customelements)
 * and adding AMP style late loading to the mix.
 *
 * The complete lifecycle of a custom DOM element is:
 *
 *           ||
 *           || createdCallback
 *           ||
 *           \/
 *    State: <NOT BUILT> <NOT UPGRADED> <NOT ATTACHED>
 *           ||
 *           || upgrade
 *           ||
 *           \/
 *    State: <NOT BUILT> <NOT ATTACHED>
 *           ||
 *           || firstAttachedCallback
 *           ||
 *           \/
 *    State: <NOT BUILT>
 *           ||
 *           || buildCallback
 *           || !getPlaceholder() => createPlaceholderCallback
 *           || preconnectCallback may be called N times after this, but only
 *           || after the doc becomes visible.
 *           || pauseCallback may be called N times after this.
 *           || resumeCallback may be called N times after this.
 *           ||
 *           \/
 *    State: <BUILT>
 *           ||
 *           || layoutCallback        <==
 *           || (firstLayoutCompleted)  ||
 *           ||                         ||
 *           \/                         || isRelayoutNeeded?
 *    State: <LAID OUT>                 ||
 *           ||                         ||
 *           ||                 =========
 *           ||
 *           || viewportCallback
 *           || unlayoutCallback may be called N times after this.
 *           ||
 *           \/
 *    State: <IN VIEWPORT>
 *
 * The preconnectCallback is called when the systems thinks it is good
 * to preconnect to hosts needed by an element. It will never be called
 * before buildCallback and it might be called multiple times including
 * after layoutCallback.
 *
 * The pauseCallback is called when when the document becomes inactive, e.g.
 * when the user swipes away from the document, or when the element is no
 * longer being displayed, e.g. when the carousel slide slides out of view.
 * In these situations, any actively playing media should pause.
 *
 * The resumeCallback is called when when the document becomes active again
 * after becoming inactive, e.g. when the user swipes away from the document
 * and swipes back. In these situations, any paused media may begin playing
 * again, if user interaction is not required.
 * TODO(jridgewell) slide slides into view
 *
 * The createPlaceholderCallback is called if AMP didn't detect a provided
 * placeholder for the element, subclasses can override this to build and
 * return a dynamically created placeholder that AMP would append to the
 * element.
 *
 * The unlayoutCallback is called when the document becomes inactive, e.g.
 * when the user swipes away from the document, or another tab is focused.
 * In these situations, expensive memory and CPU resources should be freed.
 *
 * Additionally whenever the dimensions of an element might have changed
 * AMP remeasures its dimensions and calls `onLayoutMeasure` on the
 * element instance. This can be used to do additional style calculations
 * without triggering style recalculations.
 *
 * When the dimensions of an element has changed, the 'onMeasureChanged'
 * callback is called.
 *
 * For more details, see {@link custom-element.js}.
 *
 * Each method is called exactly once and overriding them in subclasses
 * is optional.
