 * AMP Components must implement this "buildDom" function in order to be server-rendered.

 * - It must perform all of the DOM manipulations necessary to render a component.
 *   Note: this is a subset of the responsibilities of buildCallback.
 * - It must not perform any side effects, such as adding event listeners or assigning instance variables.
 * - It must not perform any of the operations involved with layoutCallback (loading).
 *
 * The return value is set to *, so that we may optionally return any DOM nodes
 * created during a client-side render. These nodes are often needed for ivars.
