  ## Introduction

  This samples demonstrates how to embed interactive charts into AMP files.

  To achieve its performance, AMP HTML doesn't allow custom Javascript.
  This doesn't mean that you can't created visually rich and interactive websites with AMP.
  For example, you can use [amp-bind](https://www.ampproject.org/docs/reference/examples/visual-tests/amp-by-example/components/amp-bind) to create dynamic and interactive features directly in AMP. However, sometimes dynamic content requires custom JS, e.g. when using a charting library. In this cases it's best to embed dynamic content using amp-iframe.

  Google Trends recently published [live search trends](https://www.google.com/trends/oscars-2016-in-google-search/index.html) about the Oscars. These gives a fascinating inside into what the billions of searches that take place each day on Google tell us about the nominated actors and movies. Part of the articles are a number of interactive and live updating graphics.

  This sample demonstrates how we can embed these into AMP files.

  <!-- ## Iframe to the Rescue -->
  <!--
    The key is to split your webpage into content that is defined with AMP...
  -->
  <section class="m1">
    <h2 class="py2 py1">Who's going to win the Oscars?</h2>
    <p>
    We have also created this interactive guide — this shows
    the day by day and minute by minute search interest in best
    picture, actor and actress nominees since the nominations were
    announced in January and will be updated to feature data from
    the awards ceremony itself.
    </p>

    ...and interactive content embedded via iframes.

    One thing to be aware of: the AMP runtime will only show iframes located at the top of a website if they provide a placeholder image. The charts in the sample are updated in real-time which means we cannot provide a placeholder image. Instead, we use an image of the chart background which stretches well to different widths.

  <amp-iframe title="Interactive chart displaying 2016 Oscar Best Picture search interest by date"

  </amp-iframe>

  <section class="p1">
    <h2 class="pb2">Where in America cares most about the Oscars?</h2>
    <p>
    It won’t surprise you to know that Hollywood consistently has
    the highest search interest in, well, Hollywood. But other
    metropolitan areas are in there too, from New York to Chicago
    to San Francisco (where Oscars parties are yearly tradition).

    Here is another interactive element embedded via an iframe.

    A positive side-effect of encapsulating interactive content into
    iframes is that it makes it easy to embed these on other
    platforms as well, for example, in a mobile app via a webview.
