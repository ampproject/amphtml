  ## Introduction

  This sample demonstrates how to implement a simple banner [AMPHTML ad](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/blob/master/extensions/amp-a4a/amp-a4a-format.md). In general an AMPHTML ad should be a valid AMP document.

  The code represents the body that should be returned as a response initiated through an [amp-ad](/components/amp-ad/) component or otherwise whenever we want to return an AMPHTML ad in any other context.

  This example consists of an image and a rendering tracking pixel that are implemented respectively using `amp-img` and `amp-pixel` components.

  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <title>Banner Ad</title>
  <script async src="https://cdn.ampproject.org/amp4ads-v0.js"></script>
  <!-- ## Setup -->
  <!--
  As part of any other AMP document, we import the canonical boiler plate to make it a valid AMP document.
  -->
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1">
  <style amp4ads-boilerplate>body{visibility:hidden}</style>
</head>
<body>

  <!-- ## Basic Usage -->
  <!--
  The anatonomy of banner ad is an image with a hyperlink to the advertiser's page. We display the image for the creative using [amp-img](/components/amp-img/).
  -->
  <a target="_blank"
     href="https://ampbyexample.com/amp_ads/banner_ad/">
    <amp-img src="https://ampbyexample.com/img/amp-300x250.jpg"
              width="300"
              height="250"
              alt="a4a image"></amp-img>
  </a>

  <!--
   We include a tracking pixel to record that the ad was rendered using [amp-pixel](https://www.ampproject.org/docs/reference/components/amp-pixel).

   Alternatively one could make use of [amp-analytics](https://www.ampproject.org/docs/reference/extended/amp-analytics.html) to enable much more comprenhensive measure activity.
