This directory contains examples of news articles written with AMP marked up
with standard schema.org markup in two different formats: JSON-LD and microdata.

Though they are effectively equivalent, we generally recommend JSON-LD as it
more easily pairs with AMP HTML Components.
<pre>
  json-ld.amp.html       - JSON-LD   structured data markup format
  microdata.amp.html     - microdata structured data markup format
</pre>
