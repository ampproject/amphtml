  <p>The poodle has been bred in at least three sizes, including Standard, Miniature, and Toy.
    According to the
    American Kennel Club, which recognised the breed in 1887,[14] the Standard Poodle is the oldest
    of the three
    varieties,[15] and was later bred down to the miniature and toy sizes.</p>

    Traditionally the Standard Poodle, the largest of the breed, was a retriever or gun dog, used in
    particular for
    duck hunting and sometimes upland bird hunting. The breed has been used for fowl hunting in US
    and Canada since
    the early 1990s, in and out of hunting tests. The modern Standard retains many of the traits
    prized by their
    original owners: a keen working intelligence that makes the dog easy to command, webbed feet
    that make it an
    agile swimmer (all of the poodle's ancestors and descendants had or share the love of water)
    athletic stamina,
    and a moisture-resistant, curly coat that acts like a wool jumper in damp conditions. Towards
    the second half of
    the nineteenth century their use in hunting declined in favour of their use in circuses and
    status symbols of
    the wealthy, so that by the 20th century they were only found as companions or circus dogs.[18]
    However, in the
    past 20 years, some breeders in the United States and Canada have been selecting for dogs with
    drive for birds
    in order to revive the breed for hunting, with some success.[19] The Canadian Kennel Club
    admitted the Standard
    Poodle for hunting trials in 1996 and the American Kennel Club in 1998, respectively.[20]
