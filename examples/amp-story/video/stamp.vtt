(Jon Newmuis)
So today, <00:00.500>we're excited to <00:01.500>announce the developer

00:02.000 --> 00:06.000
preview of AMP stories, <00:03.000>an open format for visual storytelling

00:06.000 --> 00:09.000
on mobile.

00:09.000 --> 00:12.500
To demonstrate, <00:10.000>here's a story by CNN using the format.

00:12.500 --> 00:16.500
As you can see, <00:14.000>it's very visual with these full bleed images.

00:16.500 --> 00:19.000
And you can also <00:18.000>include video assets as well.

00:19.000 --> 00:22.000
The short-form <00:20.000>bite-sized text is more easily

00:22.000 --> 00:24.000
consumable <00:23.000>on mobile.
