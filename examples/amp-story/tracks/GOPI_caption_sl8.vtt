WEBVTT - Some title

00:00.600 --> 00:04.910
You can raise your clay up.

00:04.910 --> 00:07.345
And then push it back down

00:07.350 --> 00:08.750
to make it centered.

00:08.746 --> 00:10.401
Now I'm going to build the bottom,

00:10.415 --> 00:14.435
going from the center and then pulling slowly out.
