Files under this folder are mainly one of the 2 types, differentiated
by their file name patterns:

- `*.a4a.html`: are AMPHTML ads, which need to be viewed through
  one of the supported [AMPHTML ads envelopes](../../../../contributing/TESTING.md#a4a-envelope-a4a-a4a-3p).
- `*.host.html`: are regular HTML pages that load AMPHTML ads.
