        Americans don’t have to be beholden to the tech Goliaths to get the benefits of artificial intelligence.
        An alternative possibility is for government to provide the infrastructure needed for a technological future
        —
        through a public option for artificial intelligence.
      </p>
      <p>
        Big tech companies have an extraordinary amount of data about how we behave, largely because they engage in
        widespread surveillance of much of our behavior.
        Because A.I. depends on data, these companies have a huge market advantage over start-ups and entrepreneurs
        —
        and it’s a gap that will only get wider.
        The lax regulatory environment hasn’t helped, either; instead, it has allowed the biggest tech companies to
        acquire their rivals, stifle competition and snatch up the best software engineers and data scientists.
        Together, these dynamics make it hard for start-ups, governments and nonprofits to develop and use
        artificial
        intelligence without relying on big tech companies, effectively ceding influence over this developing field
        to
        a private sphere distorted by anti-competitive practices.
      </p>
      <p>
        The alternative is a public option for A.I. The public option, a term familiar from debates over health
        care,
        is a public program that provides universal access to goods and services, with a private opt-out. A public
        option for A.I. wouldn’t prevent companies like Google from collecting and using data. But it would provide
        a
        pathway for start-ups and public-sector organizations to develop abilities and products that would compete
        with those of the tech giants. Although the Trump administration released an executive order on A.I. this
        year, we believe that a broader conceptual framework for the public option for A.I. — coupled with
        significant
        financial resources from Congress — is an opportunity for all levels of government to take control of
        technology for their constituents and engage them deeply in the development of the rules by which it is
        governed and used.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our proposal has three components: The first is a public data pool that would make data accessible to
        registered users. Local, state and federal governments have sizable data resources that would seed this
        digital commons. Users would be verified to block foreign governments, hackers and others with ill motives
        from access, and users would be prevented from using the data to engage in racial or other forms of
        discrimination and for microtargeted advertising.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some of the data may be very sensitive, and access to those resources would be highly regulated. We can
        imagine a variety of ways that regulation and technology together could protect privacy and still foster
        innovation: Data could be anonymized at the source; the commons could have an interface that allowed users
        to
        derive insight from the data set, while leaving the underlying information inaccessible; less sensitive
        data,
        like weather information, could be made available in a format optimized for training A.I. What’s more,
        methods
        for safely sharing A.I. models without disclosing the underlying data are being developed today and could
        enable users of the data commons to collaborate on public-interest A.I. services. The federal government
        should also invest in researching new and better ways to protect privacy and prevent misuse.
      </p>
      <p>
        Second, a public option for artificial intelligence would include a significant increase in research and
        development spending. Proponents of big tech celebrate private-sector research and are right to do so. But
        big
        tech companies, like all companies, have an incentive to fund research that will support their bottom line,
        and the profit motive doesn’t always mean a focus on the most important problems.
