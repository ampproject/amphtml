# Building an AMP Extension

AMP can be extended to allow more functionality and components through
building open source extensions (aka custom elements). For example, AMP
provides `amp-carousel`, `amp-sidebar` and `amp-access` as
extensions. If you'd like to add an extension to support your company
video player, rich embed or just a general UI component like a star
rating viewer, you'd do this by building an extension.

## Getting started

This document describes how to create a new AMP extension, which is one of the most common ways of adding a new feature to AMP.

Before diving into the details on creating a new AMP extension, please familiarize yourself with the [general process for contributing code and features to AMP](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/blob/master/contributing/contributing-code.md). Since you are adding a new extension you will likely need to follow the [process for making a significant change](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/blob/master/contributing/contributing-code.md#process-for-significant-changes), including filing an ["Intent to Implement" issue](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/labels/INTENT%20TO%20IMPLEMENT) and finding a guide before you start significant development.

## Naming

All AMP extensions (and built-in elements) have their tag names prefixed
with `amp-`. Make sure to choose an accurate and clear name for your
extension. For example, video players are also suffixed with `-player`
(e.g. amp-brid-player).

## Directory structure

You create your extension's files inside the `extensions/` directory.
The directory structure is below:

```sh
/extensions/amp-my-element/
├── 0.1/
|   ├── test/
|   |   ├── test-amp-my-element.js       # Element's unit test suite (req'd)
|   |   └── More test JS files (optional)
|   ├── amp-my-element.js                # Element's implementation (req'd)
|   ├── amp-my-element.css               # Custom CSS (optional)
|   └── More JS files (optional)
├── validator-amp-my-element.protoascii  # Validator rules (req'd)
├── amp-my-element.md                    # Element's main documentation (req'd)
└── More documentation in .md files (optional)
└── OWNERS                               # Owners file. Primary contact(s) for the extension. (req'd)
```

In most cases you'll only create the required (req'd) files. If your element does not need custom CSS, you don't need to create the CSS file.

## Extend AMP.BaseElement

Almost all AMP extensions extend AMP.BaseElement, which provides some
hookups and callbacks for you to override in order to implement and
customize your element behavior. These callbacks are explained below in
the BaseElement Callbacks section, and are also explained inline in the
[BaseElement](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/blob/master/src/base-element.js#L26)
class.

### Element class

The following shows the overall structure of your element implementation
file (extensions/amp-my-element/0.1/amp-my-element.js).

```js
import {func1, func2} from '../src/module';
import {CSS} from '../../../build/amp-my-element-0.1.css';
// more ES2015-style import statements.

/** @const */
const EXPERIMENT = 'amp-my-element';

/** @const */
const TAG = 'amp-my-element';

class AmpMyElement extends AMP.BaseElement {
  /** @param {!AmpElement} element */
  constructor(element) {
    super(element);

    // Declare instance variables with type annotations.
  }

  /** @override */
  isLayoutSupported(layout) {
    return layout == LAYOUT.FIXED;
  }

  /** @override */
  buildCallback() {
    // Get attributes, assertions of values, assign instance variables.
    // Build lightweight DOM and append to this.element.
  }

  /** @override */
  layoutCallback() {
    // Actually load your resource or render more expensive resources.
  }
}

AMP.extension('amp-my-element', '0.1', (AMP) => {
  AMP.registerElement('amp-my-element', AmpMyElement, CSS);
});
```

### BaseElement callbacks

#### upgradeCallback

- **Default**: Does nothing
- **Override**: Rarely.
- **[Vsync](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/blob/master/src/service/vsync-impl.js) Context**: None
- **Usage**: If your extension provides different implementations
  depending on a late runtime condition (e.g. type attribute on the
  element, platform)
- **Example Usage**: amp-ad, amp-app-banner

#### buildCallback

- **Default**: Does nothing
- **Override**: Almost always
- **Vsync Context**: Mutate
- **Usage**: If your element has UI elements this is where you should
  create your DOM structure and append it to the element. You can also
  read the attributes (e.g. width, height…) the user provided on your
  element in this callback.
- **Warning**: Don't load remote resources during the buildCallback. This
  not only circumvents the AMP resources manager, but it will also lead to
  higher data charges for users because all these resources will be loaded
  before layouting needs to happen.
- **Warning 2**: Do the least needed work here, and don't build DOM that
  is not needed at this point.

#### preconnectCallback

- **Default**: Does nothing.
- **Vsync Context**: None (Neither mutate nor measure)
- **Override**: Sometimes, if your element will be loading remote
  resources.
- **Usage**: Use to instruct AMP which hosts to preconnect to, and which
  resources to preload/prefetch; this allows AMP to delegate to the browser
  to get a performance boost by preconnecting, preloading and prefetching
  resources via preconnect service.
- **Example Usage**: [Instagram uses this to
  preconnect](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/blob/master/extensions/amp-instagram/0.1/amp-instagram.js)
  to instagram hosts.

#### createPlaceholderCallback

- **Default**: Does nothing.
- **Vsync Context**: Mutate
- **Override**: Sometimes. If your component provides a way to dynamically
  create a lightweight placeholder. This gets called only if the element
  doesn't already have a publisher-provided placeholder (through [the
  placeholder
  attribute](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/blob/master/spec/amp-html-layout.md#placeholder)).
- **Usage**: Create placeholder DOM and return it. For example,
  amp-instagram uses this to create a placeholder dynamically by creating
  an amp-img placeholder instead of loading the iframe, leaving the iframe
  loading to layoutCallback.
- **Warning**: Only use amp-elements for creating placeholders that
  require external resource loading. This allows runtime to create this
  early but still defer the resource loading and management to AMP
  resources manager. Don't create or load heavyweight resources (e.g.
  iframe…).
- **Example Usage**: amp-instagram.

#### onLayoutMeasure

- **Default**: Does nothing.
- **Vsync Context**: Measure.
- **Override**: Rarely.
- **Usage**: Use to measure layouts for your element.
- **Example Usage**: amp-iframe

#### layoutCallback

- **Default**: Does nothing.
- **Vsync Context**: Mutate
- **Override**: Almost always.
- **Usage**: Use this to actually render the final version of your
  element. If the element should load a video, this is where you load the
  video. This needs to return a promise that resolves when the element is
  considered "laid out" - usually this means load event has fired but can
  be different from element to element. Note that load events usually are
  fired very early so if there's another event that your element can
  listen to that have a better meaning of ready-ness, use that to resolve
  your promise instead - for example: [amp-youtube](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/blob/master/extensions/amp-youtube/0.1/amp-youtube.js) uses the
  playerready event that the underlying YT Player
  iframe sends to resolve the layoutCallback promise.

#### firstLayoutCompleted

- **Default**: Hide element's placeholder.
- **Vsync Context**: Mutate
- **Override**: Sometimes. If you'd like to override default behavior and
  not hide the placeholder when the element is considered first laid out.
  Sometimes you wanna control when to hide the placeholder.
- **Example Usage**: amp-anim

#### pauseCallback

- **Default**: Does nothing.
- **Vsync Context**: Mutate
- **Called**: When you swipe away from a document in a viewer. Called on
  children of lightbox when you close a lightbox instance, called on
  carousel children when the slide is not the active slide. And possibly
  other places.
- **Override**: Sometimes. Most likely if you're building a player.
- **Usage**: Use to pause video, slideshow auto-advance...etc
- **Example Usage**: amp-video, amp-youtube

#### resumeCallback

- **Default**: Does nothing.
- **Vsync Context**: Mutate
- **Override**: Sometimes.
- **Usage**: Use to restart the slideshow auto-advance.
- **Note**: This is not used widely yet because it's not possible to
  resume video playback for example on mobile.

#### unlayoutOnPause

- **Default**: Returns false.
- **Vsync Context**: Mutate
- **Override**: If your element doesn't provide a pausing mechanism,
  instead override this to unlayout the element when AMP tries to pause
  it.
- **Return**: True if you want unlayoutCallback to be called when paused.
- **Usage Example**: amp-brightcove

#### unlayoutCallback

- **Default**: Does nothing.
- **Vsync Context**: Mutate
- **Override**: Sometimes.
- **Usage**: Use to remove and unload heavyweight resources like iframes,
  video, audio and others that your element has created.
- **Return**: **True** if your element need to re-layout.
- **Usage Example**: amp-iframe

## Element styling

You can write a stylesheet to style your element to provide a minimal
visual appeal. Your element structure should account for whether you
want users (publishers and developers using your element) to customize
the default styling you're providing and allow for easy CSS classes
and/or well-structure DOM elements.

Element styles are loaded when the element script itself is included in
an AMP doc. You tell AMP which CSS belongs to this element when
registering the element (see below).

Class names prefixed with `i-amphtml` are considered private. Publishers
are not allowed to use them for customization (enforced by AMP validator).

Class names prefixed with `amp-` are public css classes that can be customized
by publishers. All such classes should be documented in the component-specific
`.md` file. All CSS classes in component stylesheets should be prefixed with
either `i-amphtml-` or `amp-`.

## Register element with AMP

Once you have implemented your AMP element, you need to register it with
AMP; all AMP extensions are prefixed with `amp-`. This is where you
tell AMP which class to use for this tag name and which CSS to load.

```javascript
AMP.extension('amp-carousel', '0.1', (AMP) => {
  AMP.registerElement('amp-carousel', CarouselSelector, CSS);
});
```

## Actions and events

AMP provides a framework for [elements to fire their own
events](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/blob/master/spec/amp-actions-and-events.md)
to allow users of that element to listen and react to the events. For
example, amp-form extension fires a few events on &lt;form&gt; elements
like `submit-success`. This allow publishers to listen to that event
and react to it, for example, by launching a lightbox to display a
message.

The other part of the event-system in AMP is actions. When listening to
an event on an element usually you'd like to trigger an action (possibly
on other elements). For example, in the example above, the publisher is
executing the `open` action on `lightbox`.

The syntax for using this on elements is as follow:

```html
<form
  on="submit-success:my-success-lightbox.open;submit-error:my-error-lightbox.open"
></form>
```

To fire events on your element use AMP's action service and the
`.trigger` method.

```javascript
actionServiceForDoc(doc.documentElement).trigger(
  this.form_,
  'submit-success',
  null
);
```

And to expose actions use `registerAction` method that your element
inherits from `BaseElement`.

```javascript
this.registerAction('close', this.close.bind(this));
```

Your element could also choose to override the `activate` method
inherited from BaseElement that would define the default action for your
element. For example amp-lightbox overrides activate to define the open
default case.

Make sure your element documentation documents the events and actions it
exposes.

## Sub-elements ownership

AMP elements are usually discovered and scheduled by the AMP runtime
automatically and managed through Resources. In some cases an AMP
element might want to control and own when its sub-elements get
scheduled and not leave that to the AMP runtime. An example to this is
the &lt;amp-carousel&gt; component, where it wants to schedule
preloading/pre-rendering or layouting of its cells based on the window
the user is in.

AMP provides a way for an element to control this by setting the owner
on the element you want to control. In the carousel example, the component loops
over all its elements and sets itself as the owner of these elements.
The AMP runtime will not manage scheduling layouting for elements that have
owners.

```javascript
this.cells_ = this.getRealChildren();

this.cells_.forEach((cell) => {
  Services.ownersForDoc(this.element).setOwner(cell, this.element);
  cell.style.display = 'inline-block';
  this.container_.appendChild(cell);
});
```

An element can then later call `schedulePreload` or `scheduleLayout` to
schedule preload or layout respectively. For example, &lt;amp-carousel
type=slider&gt; (Slider instance of amp-carousel) calls
`schedulePreload` for the next/previous slide when the user moves
forward/backward in the slides and then calls `scheduleLayout` for the
current slide when the user moves to it.

```javascript
const owners = Services.ownersForDoc(this.element);
owners.scheduleLayout(this.element, newSlide);
this.setControlsState();
owners.schedulePause(this.element, oldSlide);
owners.schedulePreload(this.element, nextSlide);
```

It's important to understand that the parent/owner element is
responsible for managing all of its children (except for placeholders,
see below). This means you need to make sure your element updates
whether the child is in viewport and when to schedule different phases
for the element.

### Nested sub-elements

Your element should anticipate its sub-elements to nest some more
amp-elements and schedule preload or layout for these as well, otherwise
the element will never be preloaded or laid out. This is true to all
nested amp-elements that are not placeholders. AMP runtime will schedule
nested amp-elements that are placeholders.

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
```html
<amp-carousel> ← Parent element
  <amp-figure> ← Parent needs to schedule this element
    <amp-img placeholder></amp-img> ← AMP will schedule this when amp-figure is scheduled
    <amp-img></amp-img> ← Parent needs to schedule this element
    <amp-fit-text></amp-fit-text> ← Parent needs to schedule this element
  </amp-figure>
</amp-carousel>
```
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

## Allowing proper validations

One of AMP's features is that a document can be checked against
validation rules to confirm it's AMP-valid. When you implement your
element, AMP validator needs to be updated to add rules for your element
to keep documents using your element valid. In order to do that you need
to file an issue on the GitHub repo select "Related to: Validator" and
mention what rules the validator needs to validate. This usually
includes

- Your element tag-name
- Required attributes for the element
- Specific values that an attribute accept (e.g. `myattr="TYPE1|TYPE2"`)
- Layouts your element supports (see [Layout specs](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/blob/master/spec/amp-html-layout.md) and [Layouts supported in your element](#layouts-supported-in-your-element))
- If there are restrictions where your element can or can't appear (e.g. disallowed_ancestory, mandatory_parent...)

For more details take a look at [Contributing Component Validator
Rules](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/blob/master/contributing/component-validator-rules.md).

## Performance considerations

### Pre-rendering and placeholders

Another enabling feature of instant-web in AMP is support for
prerendering in a way that does not consume loads of data and does not
waste too much of the user's device resources. AMP does this by strictly
controlling resource loading and rendering.

If your extension is lightweight, it might be worth enabling
pre-rendering of your elements so that users will be able to see it
appear instantly when they click on an article.

Sometimes fully pre-rendering the element isn't an option because it is
heavyweight. Your element might want to opt into creating a dynamic
placeholder for itself (in case a placeholder wasn't provided by the
developer/publisher who is using your element). This allows elements to
display content as fast as possible and allow prerendering that
placeholder. Learn [more about placeholder
elements](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/blob/master/spec/amp-html-layout.md#placeholder).

NOTE: Make sure not to request external resources in the pre-render
phase. Requests to the publisher's origin itself are OK. If in doubt,
please flag this in review.

AMP will automatically call your element's
[createPlaceholderCallback](#createplaceholdercallback) during
build step if it didn't detect a placeholder was provided. This allows
you to create your own placeholder. Here's an example of how
`amp-instagram` element used this callback to create a dynamic
placeholder of an `amp-img` element to avoid loading the heavyweight
instagram iframe embed during pre-rendering and instead loads just the
image directly from instagram media endpoint.

```javascript
class AmpInstagram extends AMP.BaseElement {
  // ...
  /** @override */
  createPlaceholderCallback() {
    const placeholder = this.getWin().document.createElement('div');
    placeholder.setAttribute('placeholder', '');
    const image = this.getWin().document.createElement('amp-img');
    // This is always the same URL that is actually used inside of the embed.
    // This lets us avoid loading the image twice and make use of browser cache.

    image.setAttribute(
      'src',
      'https://www.instagram.com/p/' +
        encodeURIComponent(this.shortcode_) +
        '/media/?size=l'
    );
    image.setAttribute('width', this.element.getAttribute('width'));
    image.setAttribute('height', this.element.getAttribute('height'));
    image.setAttribute('layout', 'responsive');
    setStyles(image, {
      'object-fit': 'cover',
    });
    const wrapper = this.element.ownerDocument.createElement('wrapper');
    // This makes the non-iframe image appear in the exact same spot
    // where it will be inside of the iframe.
    setStyles(wrapper, {
      'position': 'absolute',
      'top': '48px',
      'bottom': '48px',
      'left': '8px',
      'right': '8px',
    });
    wrapper.appendChild(image);
    placeholder.appendChild(wrapper);
    this.applyFillContent(image);
    return placeholder;
  }
  // …
}
```

**Important**: One thing to keep in mind is that when you create a
placeholder, use the amp- provided elements when loading external
resources. This is most likely going to be `amp-img` like in the
instagram case above. This still allows AMP resource manager to control
when these resources get loaded and rendered as oppose to using the
HTML-native `img` tag which will be out of AMP resource management.

#### Loading indicators

Consider showing a loading indicator if your element is expected to take
a long time to load (for example, loading a GIF, video or iframe). AMP
has a built-in mechanism to show a loading indicator simply by
whitelisting your element to show it. You can do that inside layout.js
file in the `LOADING_ELEMENTS_` object.

```javascript
export const LOADING_ELEMENTS_ = {
  ...
  'AMP-YOUTUBE': true,
  'AMP-MY-ELEMENT': true,
}
```

### Destroying heavyweight resources

To stay good to our promise of lowering resources usage especially on
mobile, elements that create and load heavyweight resources (e.g.
iframes, video, very large images, an expensive timer or computation...)
need to be destroyed when they are no longer needed.

AMP signals to your element that it needs to do that with
[unlayoutCallback](#unlayoutcallback). AMP calls this when the
document becomes inactive; like when the user swipes away from the
document to another one or when they switch tabs.

This might be also be called in special cases like if your element is
used as an amp-carousel cell and it was swiped away to become outside
the viewport. This will only happen if your element sets
`unlayoutOnPause`. Carousel by default only pauses the elements that
are outside its viewport.

Here's an example of how `amp-instagram` destroys the iframe it has
embedded when `unlayoutCallback` is called.

```javascript
/** @override */
unlayoutCallback() {
  if (this.iframe_) {
    removeElement(this.iframe_);
    this.iframe_ = null;
    this.iframePromise_ = null;
    setStyles(this.placeholderWrapper_, {
      'display': '',
    });
  }
  return true; // Call layoutCallback again.
}
```

Note if your element unlayoutCallback destroys the resources, it
probably wants to return true in order to signal to AMP the need to call
`layoutCallback` again once the document is active. Otherwise your
element will never be re-laid out.

### vsync, mutateElement, and requestChangeSize

AMP provides multiple utilities to optimize many mutations and measuring
for better performance. These include vsync service with a mutate and
measure utility method that will synchronize all measuring happening in
short period of time together and then do all the mutating in a
requestAnimationFrame or similar cycles.

### Loading external resources

If your extension needs to load external resources (like an sdk) then
you might need to add proper third party integration for it to work and
use the proper third party iframe. Loading external resources is only
allowed inside a 3p iframe which AMP serves on a different domain for
security and performance reasons. Take a look at adding
[&lt;amp-facebook&gt;](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/pull/1479/files)
extension PR for examples of 3p integration.

Read about [Inclusion of third party software, embeds and services into
AMP](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/blob/master/3p/README.md).

For contrast, take a look at amp-instagram which does NOT require an SDK
to be loaded in order to embed a post, instead it provides an
iframe-based embedding allowing amp-instagram extension to use a normal
iframe with no 3p integration needed, similarly, amp-youtube and others.

## Layouts supported in your element

AMP defines different layouts that elements can choose whether or not to
support Your element needs to announce which layouts it supports through
overriding the `isLayoutSupported(layout)` callback and returning true
if the element supports that layout. [Read more about AMP Layout
System](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/blob/master/spec/amp-html-layout.md)
and [Layout
Types](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/blob/master/spec/amp-html-layout.md#layout).

### What layout should your element support?

After understanding each layout type, if it makes sense, support all of
them. Otherwise choose what makes sense to your element. A popular
support choice is to support size-defined layouts (Fixed, Fixed Height,
Responsive and Fill) through using the utility `isLayoutSizeDefined`
in `layout.js`.

For example, `amp-pixel` only supports fixed layout.

```javascript
class AmpPixel extends BaseElement {
  /** @override */
  isLayoutSupported(layout) {
    return layout == Layout.FIXED;
  }
}
```

While `amp-carousel` supports all size-defined layouts.

```javascript
class AmpSlides extends AMP.BaseElement {
  /** @override */
  isLayoutSupported(layout) {
    return isLayoutSizeDefined(layout);
  }
}
```

## Experiments

Most newly created elements are initially launched as
[experiments](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/blob/master/tools/experiments/README.md).
This allows people to experiment with using the new element and provide
the author(s) with feedback. It also provides the AMP Team with the
opportunity to monitor for any potential errors. This is especially
required if the validator hasn't been updated yet to allow your newly
created extension, otherwise people using it in production will
invalidate all their AMP documents.

Add your extension as an experiment in the
`amphtml/tools/experiments` file by adding a record for your extension
in EXPERIMENTS variable.

```javascript
/** @const {!Array<!ExperimentDef>} */
const EXPERIMENTS = [
  // ...
  {
    id: 'amp-my-element',
    name: 'AMP My Element',
    spec:
      'https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/blob/master/extensions/' +
      'amp-my-element/amp-my-element.md',
    cleanupIssue: 'https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/issues/XXXYYY',
  },
  // ...
];
```

And then protecting your code with a check `isExperimentOn(win, 'amp-my-element')` and only execute your code when it is on.

```javascript
import {isExperimentOn} from '../../../src/experiments';
import {userAssert} from '../../../src/log';

/** @const */
const EXPERIMENT = 'amp-my-element';

/** @const */
const TAG = 'amp-my-element';

Class AmpMyElement extends AMP.BaseElement {

  /** @param {!AmpElement} element */
  constructor(element) {
    super(element);

    // declare instance variables with type annotations.
  }

  /** @override */
  isLayoutSupported(layout) {
    return layout == LAYOUT.FIXED;
  }

  /** @override */
  buildCallback() {
    userAssert(isExperimentOn(this.win, 'amp-my-element'),
        `Experiment ${EXPERIMENT} is not turned on.`);
    // get attributes, assertions of values, assign instance variables.
    // build lightweight dom and append to this.element.
  }

  /** @override */
  layoutCallback() {
    userAssert(isExperimentOn(this.win, 'amp-my-element'),
        `Experiment ${EXPERIMENT} is not turned on.`);
    // actually load your resource or render more expensive resources.
  }
}

AMP.extension('amp-my-element', '0.1', AMP => {
  AMP.registerElement('amp-my-element', AmpMyElement, CSS);
});
```

### Enabling and removing your experiment

Users wanting to experiment with your element can then go to the
[experiments page](https://cdn.ampproject.org/experiments.html) and
enable your experiment.

If you are testing on your localhost, use the command `AMP.toggleExperiment(id, true/false)` to enable the experiment.

File a github issue to cleanup your experiment. Assign it to yourself as a reminder to remove your experiment and code checks. Removal of your experiment happens after the extension has been thoroughly tested and all issues have been addressed.

## Documenting your element

Create a .md file that serves as the main documentation for your element. This document should include:

- Summary table
- Overview
- How to use it including code snippets and images
- Examples
- Attributes to specify (optional and required)
- Validation

For samples of element documentation, see: [amp-list](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/blob/master/extensions/amp-list/amp-list.md), [amp-instagram](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/blob/master/extensions/amp-instagram/amp-instagram.md), [amp-carousel](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/blob/master/extensions/amp-carousel/amp-carousel.md)

## Example of using your extension

This greatly helps users to understand and demonstrate how
your element works, and provides an easy start-point for them to
experiment with it. This is basically where you actually build an AMP
HTML document and use your element in it by creating a file in the
`examples/` directory, usually with the `my-element.amp.html` file
name. Browse that directory to see examples for other elements and
extensions.

Also consider contributing an example to
[amp.dev](https://amp.dev/) on
[GitHub](https://github.com/ampproject/amp.dev).

## Updating build configs

In order for your element to build correctly you would need to make few
changes to [`build-system/compile/bundles.config.js`](../build-system/compile/bundles.config.js) to tell it about your
extension, its files and its examples. You will need to add an entry in the `extensionBundles` array.

```javascript
exports.extensionBundles = [

## Versioning

AMP runtime is currently in v0 major version. Extensions versions are
maintained separately. If your changes to your non-experimental
extension makes breaking changes that are not backward compatible you
should version your extension. This would usually be by creating a 0.2
directory next to your 0.1.

When version 0.2 is under development, make sure that `latestVersion` is
set to 0.1 for both the 0.1 and 0.2 entries in `extensionBundles`. Once 0.2
is ready to be released, `latestVersion` can be changed to 0.2.

If your extension is still in experiments breaking changes usually are
fine so you can just update the same version.

## Unit tests

Make sure you write good coverage for your code. We require unit tests
for all checked in code. We use the following frameworks for testing:

- [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/), our test framework
- [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io/), our tests runner
- [Sinon](http://sinonjs.org/), spies, stubs and mocks.

For faster testing during development, consider using --files argument
to only run your extensions' tests.

```shell
$ gulp unit --files=extensions/amp-my-element/0.1/test/test-amp-my-element.js --watch
```

## Type checking

We use Closure Compiler to perform type checking. Please see
[Annotating JavaScript for the Closure
Compiler](https://github.com/google/closure-compiler/wiki/Annotating-JavaScript-for-the-Closure-Compiler)
and existing AMP code for examples of how to add type annotations to
your code. The following command should be run to ensure no type
violations are introduced by your extension.

```shell
$ gulp check-types
```
