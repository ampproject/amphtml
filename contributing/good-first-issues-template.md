### First Timers Only

We know figuring out the process for contributing to an open source project can be intimidating, so we created this issue as a way for you to learn the ropes. (If you feel comfortable contributing to open source projects, please leave this issue for someone else.)

<!--
List knowledge/skills the contributor should already have before working on this bug (for example, knowledge of web components, Node.js internals, etc.).  New contributors can use this section to find bugs that match their existing skills.  This also serves as a filter that can reduce the amount of explanation you will need to do in the "Step by step" section.  Try to be only as restrictive as necessary and call out any nice-to-haves.
-->

-   [ ] If you aren't too familiar with Git/GitHub, see the [Getting Started End-to-End Guide](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/blob/master/contributing/getting-started-e2e.md) for [an intro to Git & GitHub,](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/blob/master/contributing/getting-started-e2e.md#intro-to-git-and-github) and [how to get a copy of the code](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/blob/master/contributing/getting-started-e2e.md#get-a-copy-of-the-amphtml-code). You can also refer to the [Quick Start Guide](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/blob/master/contributing/getting-started-quick.md) for the necessary setup steps with less explanation than the End-to-End guide.
-   [ ] Follow the instructions for [building AMP](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/blob/master/contributing/getting-started-e2e.md#building-amp-and-starting-a-local-server).
-   [ ] [Create a Git branch](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/blob/master/contributing/getting-started-e2e.md#create-a-git-branch) for making your changes.
-   [ ] [Sign the Contributor License Agreement](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#contributor-license-agreement) before creating a Pull Request. (If you are contributing code on behalf of a corporation start this process as early as possible.)
<!--
Add steps that are specific to the issue here, e.g. perhaps they should edit a test, run `gulp unit` or `gulp integration` to see it fails, change a file and then run test again to see that the new test succeeds?  Adjust the level of detail for the background you indicated the contributor should have.
-->
-   [ ] [Commit your changes](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/blob/master/contributing/getting-started-e2e.md#edit-files-and-commit-them) frequently.
-   [ ] [Push your changes to GitHub](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/blob/master/contributing/getting-started-e2e.md#push-your-changes-to-your-github-fork).
