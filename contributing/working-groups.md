# Working groups

AMP Project working groups bring together parties with related interests to discuss ideas for how AMP can evolve and to receive updates on new features and changes in AMP that are relevant to the group.

Working groups include a group email alias as well as periodic video conferences (over Google Hangouts).

The News Publisher Working Group is currently our only active working group.  To express interest in joining the News Publisher Working Group please fill out [the interest form]().

We are actively exploring the creation of other working groups and will update this page as new working groups are created.
