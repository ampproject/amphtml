# Design Reviews

The AMP Project community holds weekly design reviews via [video conference](https://hangouts.google.com/hangouts/_/google.com/amp-eng-desrev) on Wednesdays at [1pm Pacific](https://www.google.com/?#q=1pm+pacific+in+local+time).

* [Upcoming design reviews](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/labels/Type%3A%20Design%20Review)
* [Past design reviews](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/issues?q=label%3A%22Type%3A+Design+Review%22+is%3Aclosed)

The GitHub issue for a given week's design review will have links to the designs being discussed that week.  When the design review is over the GitHub issue will include notes from the design review discussion.

**When attending a design review please read through the designs _before_ the review starts.**

## Bringing your design to a design review

If the design for an issue/feature you are working on has a scope larger than you can cover in a discussion in the GitHub issue or one of the other discussion channels, consider bringing it to a design review.

Note that the design review is optional and is not required for every new feature or bug fix.

The process for bringing a design to the design review is as follows:

* Create a software design document in a shared Google Document open to public comments.
  * A short design doc is fine as long as it covers your design in sufficient detail to allow for a review by other members of the community.
  * Take a look at [Design docs - A design doc](https://medium.com/@cramforce/design-docs-a-design-doc-a152f4484c6b) for tips on putting together a good design doc.  [Phone call tracking in AMP](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UDMYv0f2R9CvMUSBQhxjtkSnC4984t9dJeqwm_8WiAM/edit) and [New AMP Boilerplate](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gZFaKvcDffceJNaI3bYfuYPtYU5u2y6UhE5wBPTsJ9w/edit) are examples of past AMP Project design docs.
  * Add this license text to the top of your design doc before sharing it with anyone else in the community (updating the year if necessary):
      ```

      ```

* Perform a design pre-review with at least one [core committer](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/blob/master/GOVERNANCE.md); you can request a pre-review in the [#design-review Slack channel](https://amphtml.slack.com/messages/design-review/) ([sign up](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1wAE8w3K5preZnBkRk-MD1QkX8FmlRDxd_vs4bFSeJlQ/viewform?fbzx=4406980310789882877)).  It is fine to request a pre-review before your design doc is complete.

* When your design is ready to be discussed at a design review add a comment on the appropriate Design Review GitHub issue.  Post a link to the design doc and a brief summary by **1pm Pacific Monday** on the week of your design review.

* Update your design based on the feedback in the design review and any followup conversations in other channels.  Once your design is finalized, please provide a brief update at the start of a future design review (if you are able to attend) and submit a PDF version of your design doc in the [ampproject design-doc](https://github.com/ampproject/design-docs) repository.

Although design documents are strongly encouraged, for some smaller features a well-documented design in its own GitHub issue may be sufficient for a design review.

## Flexible design review time

If you have a design you would like to present but can never make the 1pm Pacific design review (e.g. you are in a different time zone) please reach out in an upcoming design review issue or on [Slack](https://amphtml.slack.com/messages/design-review/) ([sign up](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1wAE8w3K5preZnBkRk-MD1QkX8FmlRDxd_vs4bFSeJlQ/viewform?fbzx=4406980310789882877)) and we will try to find a time that works for you.
