# Design Reviews

The AMP Project community holds weekly design reviews as video conferences via Google Hangouts on Wednesdays at [1pm Pacific](https://www.google.com/?#q=1pm+pacific+in+local+time).

* [Upcoming design reviews](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/labels/Type%3A%20Design%20Review)
* [Past design reviews](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/issues?q=label%3A%22Type%3A+Design+Review%22+is%3Aclosed)

The Design Review GitHub issue for a given week will have links to the designs being discussed that week as well as a link to the Hangout.  **When attending a design review please read through the designs _before_ the review starts.**

Notes from the design review discussion will be posted in the Design Review GitHub issue shortly after the design review has finished.

## Bringing your design to a design review

If the design for an issue/feature you are working on has a scope larger than you can cover in a discussion in the GitHub issue or one of the other discussion channels, consider bringing it to a design review.

Note that the design review is optional and is not required for every new feature or bug fix.

The process for bringing a design to the design review is as follows:

* Create a software design document in a shared Google Document open to public comments.
  * A short design doc is fine as long as it covers your design in sufficient detail to allow for a review by other members of the community.
  * Take a look at [Design docs - A design doc](https://medium.com/@cramforce/design-docs-a-design-doc-a152f4484c6b) for tips on putting together a good design doc.  [Phone call tracking in AMP](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UDMYv0f2R9CvMUSBQhxjtkSnC4984t9dJeqwm_8WiAM/edit) and [New AMP Boilerplate](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gZFaKvcDffceJNaI3bYfuYPtYU5u2y6UhE5wBPTsJ9w/edit) are examples of past AMP Project design docs.
  * Add this license text to the top of your design doc before sharing it with anyone else in the community (updating the year if necessary):
      ```

      ```

* Perform a design pre-review with at least one [core committer](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/blob/master/GOVERNANCE.md); you can request a pre-review in the [#design-review Slack channel](https://amphtml.slack.com/messages/design-review/) ([sign up](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1wAE8w3K5preZnBkRk-MD1QkX8FmlRDxd_vs4bFSeJlQ/viewform?fbzx=4406980310789882877)).  It is fine to request a pre-review before your design doc is complete.

* When your design is ready to be discussed at a design review add a comment on the appropriate Design Review GitHub issue.  Post a link to the design doc and a brief summary by **1pm Pacific Monday** on the week of your design review.

* Update your design based on the feedback in the design review and any followup conversations in other channels.  Once your design is finalized, please provide a brief update at the start of a future design review (if you are able to attend) and submit a PDF version of your design doc in the [ampproject design-doc](https://github.com/ampproject/design-docs) repository.

Although design documents are strongly encouraged, for some smaller features a well-documented design in its own GitHub issue may be sufficient for a design review.

## Flexible design review time

If you have a design you would like to present but can never make the 1pm Pacific design review (e.g. you are in a different time zone) please reach out in an upcoming design review issue or on [Slack](https://amphtml.slack.com/messages/design-review/) ([sign up](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1wAE8w3K5preZnBkRk-MD1QkX8FmlRDxd_vs4bFSeJlQ/viewform?fbzx=4406980310789882877)) and we will try to find a time that works for you.
