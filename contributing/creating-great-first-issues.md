# Creating Great First Issues

The AMP Project encourages new contributors but for someone who is new to open source projects, Git/GitHub or the AMP codebase figuring out how to get started can be difficult.

To help new contributors to the AMP Project get oriented we curate a set of [Great First Issues](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Great+First+Issues%22).  We depend on people who have been in the community for a while to identify bugs/features that would serve as good starter issues and create a well-documented Great First Issue for them.

We are borrowing our approach from [Hoodie](http://hood.ie/) which collects starter issues in their [Hoodie Camp](https://github.com/hoodiehq/camp).  See the [Hoodie Camp Issues](https://github.com/hoodiehq/camp/issues) for many examples of what great first issues look like.  (Hoodie's [Welcoming Communities](http://hood.ie/blog/welcoming-communities.html) post is also a great read.)

## Qualities of a Great First Issues

Keep these qualities in mind when creating your Great First Issues:

* **You should have a good sense of exactly what is needed to resolve the issue.**  In fact it would probably be faster for you to just fix the issue than to create the Great First Issue, but the benefits to the community make the cost of creating the Great First Issue worth it.
* **An issue that may at first seem "too small" may actually be the right size for someone who is brand new to open source contributing.**  The focus of a Great First Issue is not just about getting fixes in AMP--it's also a chance for new contributors to get set up with Git/GitHub, get familiar with building/making changes/testing in AMP and going through the Pull Request process.
* **The issue should be P3.**  The issue may not get picked up right away and the person fixing it may run encounter problems while working on it so it shouldn't be a bug that requires an immediate fix.
* **New contributors have a variety of backgrounds; we should have a variety of Great First Issues.**  The goal isn't for each Great First Issue to be a great first issue for _every_ new contributor.  Some new contributors may have extensive web development experience but haven't used Git; some may know everything about Git & Pull Requests but don't have a lot of experience with web components.  You can specify "What you will need to know" in the bug so new contributors can find a Great First Issue that matches their current experience.

## Great First Issue Template

The [Great First Issues Template](great-first-issues-template.md) contains a template you should use when creating your Great First Issue.  Copy the [raw markdown](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ampproject/amphtml/master/contributing/great-first-issues-template.md) into your issue and follow the guidance in the comments.
