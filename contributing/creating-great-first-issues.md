# Creating Great First Issues

The AMP Project encourages new contributors but for someone who is new to source projects, Git/GitHub or even the AMP codebase figuring out how to get started can be difficult.

To help new contributors to the AMP Project get oriented we curate a set of [Great First Issues](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Great+First+Issues%22).  We depend on people who have been in the community for a while to identify bugs/features that would serve as good starter issues and create a well-documented Great First Issue for them.

We are borrowing our approach from [Hoodie](http://hood.ie/).  Hoodie collects starter issues in their [Hoodie Camp](https://github.com/hoodiehq/camp).  See the [Hoodie Camp Issues](https://github.com/hoodiehq/camp/issues) for many examples of what great first issues look like.  (Hoodie's [Welcoming Communities](http://hood.ie/blog/welcoming-communities.html) post is also a great read.)

## Qualities of a Great First Issues

Keep these qualities in mind when creating your Great First Issues:

* **You should have a good sense of exactly what is needed to resolve the issue.**  In fact, it would probably be faster for you to just fix the issue than to create the Great First Issue.
* **An issue that may at first seem "too small" may actually be the right size for someone who is brand new to open source contributing.**  The focus of a Great First Issue is not just about getting fixes in AMP; it's also a chance for new contributors to get set up with Git/GitHub, get familiar with building/making changes/testing in AMP and going through the Pull Request process.
* **The issue should be P3.**  The issue may not get picked up right away and the person fixing it may run encounter problems while working on it.
* **New contributors have a variety of backgrounds; we should have a variety of Great First Issues.**  The goal isn't for each Great First Issue to be a great first issue for _every_ new contributor.  Some new contributors may have extensive web development experience but haven't used Git; some may know everything about Git & Pull Requests but don't have a lot of experience with web components.  You can specify "What you will need to know" in the bug so new contributors can find one that matches their current experience.

## Great First Issue Template

The [Great First Issues Template](great-first-issues-template.md) contains a template you should use when creating your Great First Issue.  Copy the [raw markdown](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ampproject/amphtml/master/contributing/great-first-issues-template.md) into your issue, and follow the guidance in the comments.
