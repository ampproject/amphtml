**Pro tip:** All the above commands can be run in debug mode using `node --inspect`. This will make the Chrome debugger stop at `debugger;` statements, after which local state can be inspected using dev tools.

For example, in order to debug `gulp serve`, run the following command:

```sh
node --inspect $(which gulp) serve
```

## Manual testing

For manual testing build AMP and start the Node.js server by running `gulp`.

### Serve Mode

There are 5 serving modes:

-   DEFAULT mode serves unminified AMP. Use this during normal development by simply running `gulp`.
-   COMPILED mode serves minified AMP. This is closer to what is served in production on the stable channel. Serve this mode by running `gulp --compiled`.
-   CDN mode serves stable channel binaries. Local changes are not served in this mode. Serve CDN mode by running `gulp serve --cdn`.
-   RTV mode serves the bundle from the given RTV number (a 15 digit number). E.g. `001907161745080`. Serve RTV mode by running `gulp serve --rtv <rtv_number>`
-   ESM mode serves the esm (module) binaries. First run `gulp dist --fortesting --esm` and then serve esm mode by running `gulp serve --new_server --esm`. _This mode is new, and under active development._

To switch serving mode during runtime, go to http://localhost:8000/serve_mode=MODE and set `MODE` to one of the following values: `default`, `compiled`, `cdn` or `<RTV_NUMBER>`.

### Examples

The content in the `examples` directory can be reached at: http://localhost:8000/examples/

### Document proxy

AMP ships with a local proxy for testing production AMP documents with the local JS version.

For any public AMP document like: `http://output.jsbin.com/pegizoq/quiet`,

You can access it with the local JS by using the form in
[`http://localhost:8000`](http://localhost:8000) or by accessing the proxy URL
directly:

`http://localhost:8000/proxy/output.jsbin.com/pegizoq/quiet`.

**Note:** The local proxy will serve minified or unminified JS based on the current serve mode. When serve mode is `cdn`, the local proxy will serve remote JS.
When accessing minified JS make sure you run `gulp dist` with the `--fortesting`
flag so that we do not strip out the localhost code paths. (We do some
code elimination to trim down the file size for the file we deploy to production)

If the origin resource is on HTTPS, the URLs are http://localhost:8000/proxy/s/output.jsbin.com/pegizoq/quiet

### <a name="a4a-envelope"></a>A4A envelope (/a4a/, /a4a-3p/)

If you are working on AMPHTML ads, you can use the local A4A envelope for testing local and production AMP documents with the local JS version.

A4A can be run either of these two modes:

1. Friendly iframe mode: http://localhost:8000/a4a/...
2. 3p iframe mode: http://localhost:8000/a4a-3p/...

The following forms are supported:

-   local document: http://localhost:8000/a4a[-3p]/examples/animations.amp.html
-   proxied document with local sources: http://localhost:8000/a4a[-3p]/proxy/output.jsbin.com/pegizoq/quiet

When accessing minified JS make sure you run `gulp dist` with the `--fortesting`
flag so that we do not strip out the localhost code paths. (We do some
code elimination to trim down the file size for the file we deploy to production)

If the origin resource is on HTTPS, the URLs are http://localhost:8000/a4a[-3p]/proxy/s/output.jsbin.com/pegizoq/quiet

Notice that all documents are assumed to have a "fake" signature. Thus, this functionality is only available in the
`localDev` mode.

Additionally, the following query parameters can be provided:

-   `width` - the width of the `amp-ad` (default "300")
-   `height` - the height of the `amp-ad` (default "250")
-   `offset` - the offset to push the `amp-ad` down the page (default "0px"). Can be used to push the Ad out of the viewport, e.g. using `offset=150vh`.

### In-a-box envelope (/inabox/)

If you are working on AMP In-a-box Ads, you can use the local in-a-box envelope for testing local and production AMP documents with the local JS version.

The following forms are supported:

-   local document: http://localhost:8000/inabox/examples/animations.amp.html
-   proxied document with local sources: http://localhost:8000/inabox/proxy/output.jsbin.com/pegizoq/quiet

Additionally, the following query parameters can be provided:

-   `width` - the width of the `iframe` (default "300")
-   `height` - the height of the `iframe` (default "250")
-   `offset` - the offset to push the `iframe` down the page (default "0px"). Can be used to push the Ad out of the viewport, e.g. using `offset=150vh`.

### Chrome extension

For testing documents on arbitrary URLs with your current local version of the AMP runtime we created a [Chrome extension](../testing/local-amp-chrome-extension/README.md).

## Visual Diff Tests

In addition to building the AMP runtime and running `gulp [unit|integration]`, the automatic test run on Travis includes a set of visual diff tests to make sure a new commit to `master` does not result in unintended changes to how pages are rendered. The tests load a few well-known pages in a browser and compare the results with known good versions of the same pages.

The technology stack used is:

-   [Percy](https://percy.io/), a visual regression testing service for webpages
-   [Puppeteer](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/puppeteer/), a driver capable of loading webpages for diffing
-   [Percy-Puppeteer](https://github.com/percy/percy-puppeteer), a framework that integrates Puppeteer with Percy
-   [Headless Chrome](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/lkgr/headless/README.md), the Chrome/Chromium browser in headless mode

The [`ampproject/amphtml`](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml) repository on GitHub is linked to the [Percy project](https://percy.io/ampproject/amphtml) of the same name. All PRs will show a check called `percy/amphtml` in addition to the `continuous-integration/travis-ci/pr` check. If your PR results in visual diff(s), clicking on the `details` link will show you the snapshots with the diffs highlighted.

### Failing Tests

When a test run fails due to visual diffs being present, click the `details` link next to `percy/amphtml` in your PR and examine the results. By default, Percy highlights the changes between snapshots in red. Clicking on the new snapshot will show it in its raw form. If the diffs indicate a problem that is likely to be due to your PR, you can try running the visual diffs locally in order to debug (see section below). However, if you are sure that the problem is not due to your PR, you may click the green `Approve` button on Percy to approve the snapshots and unblock your PR from being merged.

### Flaky Tests

If a Percy test flakes and you would like to trigger a rerun, you can't do that from within Percy. Instead, from your PR on GitHub open up the "Details" for the `continuous-integration/travis-ci/pr` check to load the Travis run for your PR. There you should see a "passed" test shard labeled "Visual Diff Tests". Click the "Restart Job" icon on just that shard to trigger a rerun on Percy.

### How Are Tests Executed

Visual diff tests are defined in the [`visual-tests`](../test/visual-diff/visual-tests), see file for the configurations of each test. When running, the visual diff test runner does the following for each test case:

-   Navgates to the defined page using a headless Chrome browser
-   Waits for the page to finish loading, both by verifying idle network connections and lack of loader animations
-   If defined, waits until the appropriate CSS selectors appear/disappear from the page
-   If defined, waits an arbitrary amount of time (e.g., for components that have time-delayed mutations)
-   If defined, executes any custom interaction test code
-   Uploads a snapshot of the page's DOM (converted to an HTML string) to the Percy service

When all snapshots finish uploading, Percy will process the visual diffs and report back to GitHub as a pull request status. Percy renders the snapshots in their own browsers and take a screenshot. If the new screenshot differs from the previously approved screenshot you will get a visual highlighting of where that difference lies.

Percy DOES NOT by default run JavaScript, so the same DOM snapshot will be used in displaying mobile and desktop versions of the page. This means that if your page looks different between these two device types, it should be able to do that using CSS only.

### Adding and Modifying Visual Diff Tests

#### One-time Setup

First create a free Percy account at [https://percy.io](https://percy.io), create a project, and set the `PERCY_TOKEN` environment variable using the unique value you find at `https://percy.io/<org>/<project>/integrations`:

```sh
export PERCY_TOKEN="<unique-percy-token>"
```

Once the environment variable is set up, you can run the AMP visual diff tests. You can also pass this token directly to `gulp visual-diff --percy_token="<unique-percy-token>"`

#### Writing the Test

To start, create the page and register it in the configuration file for visual diff tests:

-   Create an AMP document that will be tested under `examples/visual-tests`.
-   Add an entry in the [`test/visual-diff/visual-tests`](../test/visual-diff/visual-tests) JSON5 file. Documentation for the various settings are in that file.
    -   Must set fields: `url`, `name`
    -   You will also likely want to set `loading_complete_css` and maybe also `loading_incomplete_css`
    -   Only set `viewport` if your page looks different on mobile vs. desktop, and you intend to create a separate config for each
        -   The `viewport` setting wraps the entire DOM snapshot inside an `<iframe>` before uploading to Percy. Beware of weird iframe behaviors! 🐉
    -   Do not set `enable_percy_javascript` without consulting `@ampproject/wg-infra`
    -   Point `interactive_tests` to a JavaScript file if you would like to add interactions to the page. See examples of existing interactive tests to learn how to write those
-   (For past examples of pull requests that add visual diff tests, see [#17047](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/pull/17047), [#17110](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/pull/17110))

Now, verify your test by executing it:

-   Build the AMP runtime in minified mode:
    ```sh
    gulp dist --fortesting
    ```
    -   You can verify that your page looks as intented by running `gulp serve --compiled` and opening it in a browser
-   Execute the visual diff tests:
    ```sh
    gulp visual-diff --nobuild
    ```
    -   Add `--grep="<regular expression>"` to the command to execute a subset of the tests. e.g., `gulp visual-diff --grep="amp-[a-f]"` will execute on tests that have an AMP component name between `<amp-a...>` through `<amp-f...>`.
    -   Note that if you drop the `--nobuild` flag, `gulp visual-diff` will run `gulp dist --fortesting` on each execution. This is time consuming, so only drop it if you are changing the runtime/extension code and not just the test files
    -   To see debugging info during Percy runs, you can add `--chrome_debug`, `--webserver_debug`, or `--debug` for both.
-   When the test finishes executing it will print a URL to Percy where you can inspect the results. It should take about a minute to finish processing.
-   Inspect the build on Percy. If you are not happy with the results, fix your page or code, and repeat. If all is well, approve it. This creates a new baseline on Percy, against which all following builds will be compared.
-   After approving your test, repeat the `gulp visual-diff` command at least 5 more times. If any of the subsequent runs fails with a visual changes, this means that your test is flaky.
    -   Flakiness is usually caused by bad `loading_complete_css` configurations
    -   To find what CSS selector appear _exclusively_ after the page settles into the expected result, download the _baseline_ and _new_ source for the snapshots that Percy used in the build that flaked, and compare them using a text diff application

## Isolated Component Testing

To speed up development and testing of components, it is advised to use the Storybook dashboard and develop "stories" (testing scenarios) for components. Storybook has many features that assist with the isolated development and manual testing of components including easy manual interaction with component parameters, integrated accessibility auditing, responsiveness testing, etc.

AMP includes two Storybook environments: `storybook-amp` (for components living inside AMP pages) and `storybook-preact` (simulating Bento components living in a Preact/React app).

To run these environments and explore existing AMP components, run

```sh
gulp storybook-amp
# ------ or ------
gulp storybook-preact
```

Test scenarios (stories) live inside each of the components' directories, stories ran in the AMP environment have the `.amp.js` extension:

```sh
# Preact environment test scenario
./extensions/amp-example/0.1/storybook/Basic.js
# AMP environment test scenario
./extensions/amp-example/0.1/storybook/Basic.amp.js
```

Read more about [Writing Storybook Test Scenarios](https://storybook.js.org/docs/guides/guide-preact/#step-4-write-your-stories) in the official [Storybook documentation](https://storybook.js.org/docs/).

## Testing on devices

### Testing with ngrok

It's much faster to debug with local build (`gulp` + `http://localhost:8000/`). In Chrome you can use [DevTools port forwarding](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/remote-debugging/local-server). However, iOS Safari does not give a similar option. Instead, you can use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/). Just [download](https://ngrok.com/download) the ngrok binary for your platform and run it like this:

```sh
ngrok http 8000
```

Once started, the ngrok will print URLs for both `http` and `https`. E.g. `http://73774d8c.ngrok.io/` and `https://73774d8c.ngrok.io/`. These URLs can be used to debug on iOS and elsewhere.

### Testing with Firebase

For deploying and testing local AMP builds on [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/), install firebase and initialize firebase within this directory\* (a `firebase` folder can be generated with the command, `gulp firebase`).

```sh
npm install -g firebase-tools
firebase login
firebase init
gulp firebase
firebase deploy
```

-   When initializing firebase within the directory via `firebase init`, make sure to select the following options when asked:

*   "Which Firebase CLI features do you want to setup for this folder?" select `Hosting: Configure and deploy Firebase Hosting sites`.
*   "What do you want to use as your public directory?" enter `firebase`.
*   "Select a default Firebase project for this directory:" select your project name if it's already created, otherwise choose `[don't setup a new project]` and add one later.
    -   Note: If you haven't already, you will have to create a project via the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com) after you are done initializing and before you deploy. Once you create the project, you can make it active in your CLI with `firebase use your-project-name` or give it an alias by selecting your project after running `firebase use --add`.
*   "Configure as a single-page app (rewrite all urls to /index.html)?" select `n`.

`gulp firebase` will generate a `firebase` folder and copy over all files from `dist`, `examples` and `test/manual`. It will rewrite all urls in the copied files to point to the local versions of AMP (i.e. the ones copied from `dist` to `firebase/dist`). When you initialize firebase, you should set the `firebase` `public` directory to `firebase`. This way `firebase deploy` will just directly copy and deploy the contents of the generated `firebase` folder. As an example, your `firebase.json` file can look something like this:

```json
{
  "hosting": {
    "public": "firebase",
    "ignore": ["firebase.json", "**/.*", "**/node_modules/**"]
  }
}
```

If you are only testing a single file, you can use `gulp firebase --file=path/to/my/file.amp.html` to avoid copying over all of `test/manual` and `examples`. It will copy over the specified file to `firebase/index.html`, which simplifies debugging.

After deploying, you can access your project publically at its hosting URL `https://your-project-name.firebaseapp.com`.

Additionally, you can create multiple projects and switch between them in the CLI using `firebase use your-project-name`.

#### Testing Ads

Testing ads in deployed demos requires allowlisting of 3p urls. You can do this by adding your intended deployment hostname as an environemnt variable `AMP_TESTING_HOST` and using the `fortesting` flag. For example:

```sh
export AMP_TESTING_HOST="my-project.firebaseapp.com"
gulp firebase --fortesting
firebase deploy
```

This will write "my-project.firebaseapp.com" as a third party url to relevant attributes in `AMP_CONFIG`, which is prepended to `amp.js` and `integration.js` files in the firebase folder. If you're curious about how this is done, feel free to inspect `build-system/tasks/firebase.js`.

## End-to-End Tests

You can run and create E2E tests locally during development. Currently tests only run on Chrome, but support for additional browsers is underway. These tests have not been added to our CI build yet - but they will be added soon.

Run all tests with:

```sh
gulp e2e
```

The task will kick off `gulp build` and then `gulp serve` before running the tests. To skip building the runtime, use `--nobuild`.

[Consult the E2E testing documentation](../build-system/tasks/e2e/README.md) to learn how to create your own end-to-end tests.

## Performance Testing Node Build Tools

You can create flamecharts for any node process used by the build system by leveraging `0x` which is included as a `devDepenendency`.

Here's an example for `gulp dist --closure_concurrency=1`:

```sh
npx 0x -o node_modules/.bin/gulp dist --closure_concurrency=1
```

Important to note is `0x` will automatically create a flamechart and a serving folder locally within the repository, please don't add them to PRs!
