# SDK integration for AMPHTML ad
One goal of AMPHTML ad is for advertisers to create ad once and use 
every where. This guide provides details about how an ad network can 
join us to serve and render AMPHTML ad in various environment, for 
example regular web & native mobile apps.

## Terminologies

###### AMPHTML ad
Ad creatives that are written following the
 [AMPHTML ad spec](https://amp.dev/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/learn/a4a_spec).
 
###### inabox
A term describes the situation that an AMPHTML ad is being served
on a non-AMP environment, e.g a regular web page inside an iframe embed 
or a native mobile app inside a WebView. This is very different from how
 AMPHTML ad gets rendered on an AMP page, where the page and ad shares 
 the same JS runtime.

###### host
The web page or native mobile app that the ad is being served on.

###### friendly iframe
An iframe on the host page that has the same origin, so that it has
full access to the host page content.

###### foreign iframe
An iframe on the host page that has different origin, so it can only
communicate to the host page via postMessage API.

## Web SDK (ads tag) integration
This is the case when AMPHTML ad is being served and rendered on a
regular web page (non-AMP) inside an iframe. The iframe can be either
a friendly iframe, or a foreign iframe. 

##### Friendly iframe
Using friendly iframe requires zero to little work for the ads tag 
integration. Because AMPHTML is trustful & secure, it can be put inside
 a friendly iframe without worrying it hijacking the page
and ruining the end user experience. Meantime, friendly iframe rendering
in general requires less browser resources than foreign iframe rendering,
which not only brings performance benefit but also revenue gain. One 
thing to keep in mind though is that the ad network should have their own 
mechanism to prevent pub
modifying the ad content or faking clicks. Google Ad Manager uses this
 approach to integrate with AMPHTML ads.

Main work flow:
1. The ads tag makes an ad request.
1. The response contains a flag indicating it is an AMPHTML ad.
1. The ads tag creates a friendly iframe, and set the response content 
to the iframe using `srcdoc`.

In the 2nd step, if the ad is generated by a 3rd party, it's a good 
 idea to run it through an AMP validator to make sure it is valid AMP.
 
Note that this friendly iframe approach right now is in an experimental
stage. Put the following meta tag in the head of the ad HTML to opt-in 
the experiment:
`<meta name="amp-experiments-opt-in" content="inabox-viewport-friendly">`.

##### Foreign iframe
If the ad has to be put into a foreign iframe, the ads tag is 
responsible to set up the communication channel for the ad to complete 
various tasks such as ad expansion or viewability tracking. A so-called
host script is to be loaded in that case to fulfill the requirements.

Main work flow:
1. The ads tags sets up a postMessage listener on host window.
1. The ads tag creates an iframe with `src` set to the ad request URL.
1. If the response is an AMPHTML ad, it will postMessage to the host 
window. The AMP runtime version number is included in the message.
1. The ads tag received the message then starts to load the 
corresponding host script: 
`https://cdn.ampproject.org/rtv/{version}/amp4ads-host-v0.js`
1. Before host script is loaded, ads tag is still responsible to queue 
up all coming AMP messages into a global array.
1. Once host script is fully loaded, ads tag can then hand over the job to
it to process the queued messages and listen for future messages.

A sample implementation of the above process can be found [here](../../../../examples/inabox-tag-integration.js).

## Mobile SDK integration
