# Objective

Outline requirements and steps for ad network to implement Fast Fetch for early ad request and support for AMP Ads returned by the ad network to be given preferential rendering. 

# Background

Relevant design documents:  [A4A Readme](./a4a-readme.md), [A4A Format Guide](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/blob/master/extensions/amp-a4a/amp-a4a-format.md) & [intent to implement](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/issues/3133).

If you haven’t already, please read the A4A Readme to learn about why all networks should implement Fast Fetch. 

# Overview

Fast Fetch provides preferential treatment to Verified AMP Ads over Legacy Ads, unlike the current 3P rendering flow which treats AMP Ads and Legacy Ads the same. Within Fast Fetch, if an ad fails validation, that ad is wrapped in a cross-domain iframe to sandbox it from the rest of the AMP document. Conversely, an AMP Ad passing validation is written directly into the page. Fast Fetch handles both AMP and non-AMP ads; no additional ad requests are required for ads that fail validation.  

In order to support Fast Fetch, ad networks will be required to implement the following:

* [XHR CORS](https://www.w3.org/TR/cors/) for the ad request

* The Javascript to build the ad request must be located within the AMP HTML github repository (example implementations: [AdSense](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/tree/master/extensions/amp-ad-network-adsense-impl) & [Doubleclick](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/tree/master/extensions/amp-ad-network-doubleclick-impl)).

# Detailed Design

## Ad server requirements

### SSL

All network communication via the AMP HTML runtime (resources or XHR) require SSL.

### AMP Ad Creative Signature

In order for the AMP runtime to know that a creative is valid [AMP](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/blob/master/extensions/amp-a4a/amp-a4a-format.md), and thus receive preferential ad rendering, it must pass a client-side, validation check.  The creative must be sent by the ad network to a validation service which verifies the creative conforms to the [specification](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/blob/master/extensions/amp-a4a/amp-a4a-format.md).  If so, it will be rewritten by the validation service and the rewritten creative and a cryptographic signature will be returned to the ad network.  The rewritten creative and signature must be included in the response to the AMP runtime from the ad network. The AMP runtime will then parse out the creative and the signature from the ad response.  Lack of, or invalid signature will cause the runtime to treat it as a Legacy Ad, rendering it within a cross domain iframe and using delayed ad rendering.

Client side verification of the signature, and thus preferential rendering, requires a browser to have Web Crypto. However, if a browser does not have Web Crypto, Fast Fetch is still able to be used if the ad network permits it. In this case, the ad will simply be guaranteed to render in a cross-domain iframe.

### Ad Response Headers

*See Figure 1 above, Part C*

Fast Fetch requires that the ad request be sent via [XHR CORS](https://www.w3.org/TR/cors/) as this allows for direct communication with the ad network without the possibility of custom javascript execution (e.g. iframe or JSONP).  XHR CORS requires a preflight request where the response needs to indicate if the request is allowed by including the following headers in the response::

* "Access-Control-Allow-Origin" with value matching the value of the request "Origin" header only if the origin domain is allowed ("Note that requests from pages hosted on the Google AMP Cache will have a value matching the domain [https://cdn.ampproject.org](https://cdn.ampproject.org)").

* "AMP-Access-Control-Allow-Source-Origin" with value matching the value of the request parameter "__amp_source_origin" which is [added](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/blob/master/src/service/xhr-impl.js#L103) by the AMP HTML runtime and matches the origin of the request had the page not been served from [Google AMP Cache](https://www.ampproject.org/docs/get_started/about-amp.html) (the originating source of the page).  Ad network can use this to prevent access by particular publisher domains where lack of response header will cause the response to be [dropped](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/blob/master/src/service/xhr-impl.js#L137) by the AMP HTML runtime.

* "Access-Control-Allow-Credentials" with value "true" if cookies should be included in the request.

* "Access-Control-Expose-Headers" with value matching comma separated list any non-standard response headers included in the response.  At a minimum, this should include "AMP-Access-Control-Allow-Source-Origin".  If other custom headers are not included, they will be dropped by the browser.

## A4A Extension Implementation

The [AMP Ad](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/blob/master/extensions/amp-ad/amp-ad.md) element differentiates between different ad network implementations via the type attribute, e.g. the following amp-ad will utilize DoubleClick: 

  <amp-ad width=320 height=50 **type****=****"doubleclick"** data-slot="/43821041/mobile_ad_banner">

To create an ad network implementation, the following steps must be taken:

Create a new extension within the extensions section in the AMP HTML Github [repository](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml) whose path and name match the type attribute given for amp ad element as follows: 

![Image of File Hierarchy](./2.png)
Figure 2: A4A Extension File Hierarchy


Ad networks that want to add support for Fast Fetch within AMP must add the file hierarchy as seen in Figure 2 to the AMP repository, with `<TYPE>` replaced by their own network. Files must implement all requirements as specified below. Anything not specified, i.e. helper functions etc are at the discretion of the ad network, but must be approved by AMP project members just as any other contributions.

### `amp-ad-network-<TYPE>-impl.js`

*See Figure 1 Parts B and D*

Implement class `AmpAdNetwork<TYPE>Impl`. This class must extend [AmpA4A](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/blob/master/extensions/amp-a4a/0.1/amp-a4a.js). This class must overwrite the super class method **getAdUrl()**.


``` javascript
getAdUrl() - must construct and return the ad url for ad request.
  // @return {string} - the ad url
```


Examples of network implementations can be seen for [DoubleClick](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/blob/master/extensions/amp-ad-network-doubleclick-impl/0.1/amp-ad-network-doubleclick-impl.js) and [AdSense](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/blob/master/extensions/amp-ad-network-adsense-impl/0.1/amp-ad-network-adsense-impl.js). 

Usage of getAdUrl can be seen within the this.adPromise_ promise chain in [amp-a4a.js](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/blob/master/extensions/amp-a4a/0.1/amp-a4a.js)

### `<TYPE>-a4a-config.js`

*See Figure 1: Part A*

Must implement and export following function. 

``` javascript
<TYPE>IsA4AEnabled(win, element)
  // @param (Window) win Window where AMP runtime is running.
  // @param (HTML Element) element ****The amp-ad element.
  // @return (boolean) Whether or not A4A should be used in this context. 
```

Once this file is implemented, [amphtml/ads/_a4a-config.js](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/blob/master/ads/_a4a-config.js) must also be updated. Specifically, `<TYPE>IsA4AEnabled()` must be imported, and it must be mapped to the ad network type in the a4aRegistry mapping. 

``` javascript
/**amphtml/ads/_a4a-config.js */
…
import {
  <TYPE>IsA4AEnabled
} from ‘../extensions/amp-ad-<TYPE>-impl/0.1/<TYPE>-a4a-config’; 
…
export const a4aRegistry = map({
  …
  ‘<TYPE>’: <TYPE>IsA4AEnabled,
  …
});
```

Example configs for [DoubleClick](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/blob/master/extensions/amp-ad-network-doubleclick-impl/0.1/doubleclick-a4a-config.js#L80) and [AdSense](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/blob/master/extensions/amp-ad-network-adsense-impl/0.1/adsense-a4a-config.js#L68)

Usage of DoubleClick and AdSense configs can be seen in [_a4a-config.js](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/blob/master/ads/_a4a-config.js)
