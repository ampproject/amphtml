# Weborama

## Example

**Display tag:**

See below for an example of usage or our display tag, adapted for use with AMP websites:

```html
<amp-ad width="300" height="250"
    type="weborama-display"
    data-wbo_account_id=51
    data-wbo_tracking_element_id=137
    data-wbo_fullhost="certification.solution.weborama.fr"
    data-wbo_random="[RANDOM]"
    data-wbo_publisherclick="[PUBLISHER_TRACKING_URL]">
  <div placeholder>Loading ad.</div>
  <div fallback>Ad could not be loaded.</div>
</amp-ad>
```

**Conversion tag:**

In order to add conversion trackers to your page, please use the AMP pixel component that will be supplied to you by your Weborama contact.
The values mentioned between brackets `[]` should be replaced by the proper values.

`DOCUMENT_REFERRER`, `SOURCE_URL` and `RANDOM` should remain in the URL, as AMP takes care of the automatic substitution of these values.

```html
<amp-pixel src="http://[YOUR_HOST].solution.weborama.fr/fcgi-bin/dispatch.fcgi?a.A=co&a.si=[SITE_ID]&a.cp=[CONVERSION_PAGE]&a.ct=b&g.ru=DOCUMENT_REFERRER&g.pu=SOURCE_URL&g.cb=RANDOM"></amp-pixel>
```


## Configuration

**Placeholder and fallback:**

The placeholder and fallback `div` elements are completely optional and can be left out.

- The placeholder is shown while the ad is loading.
- The fallback is served when there is no ad to show for some reason.

**Dimensions:**

By default the ad size is based on the `width` and `height` attributes of the `amp-ad` tag. These are listed as mandatory parameters.

The AMP ad component requires the following HTML attributes to be added before the ad will be parsed as a Weborama ad:

- width
- height
- type="weborama-display"

**Mandatory data parameters:**

Without valid values for these parameters we won't be able to display an ad:

- `data-wbo_account_id`
- `data-wbo_tracking_element_id`
- `data-wbo_fullhost`

**Examples of optional parameters:**

Here are some extra parameters that might be set on the AMP ad:

- `data-wbo_random` - Used as session identifier by some 3rd party ad systems
- `data-wbo_publisherclick` - Adds a publisher redirect for the exit click.
- `data-wbo_vars` - Sends variables to the creative. e.g.: `color=green&weather=rainy`
- `data-wbo_debug` - Launch the ad in debug mode.
- ... ask your contact at Weborama for more details.

## Current restrictions

- AMP ads are launched in a cross-origin iframe, so there currently is no support for some rich media, amongst which:
  - Expandables
  - Floorads, Interstitials and other types of layers
  - Flash ads
  - Creatives served over HTTP.
- Click and impression trackers can't be added to the tag. They need to be added through Weborama's ad platform: WCM.
- At the moment we don't support dynamic resizing of the iframe. Support for this will be added on request.
