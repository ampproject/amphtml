# Index Exchange

Index supports Header Tag style bidding using Doubleclick as the ad server.

## Example

```html
<amp-ad width=300 height=250
  type="ix"
  data-ix-id="54321"
  data-slot="/1234/example"
</amp-ad>
```

## Configuration

For semantics of configuration, please contact your account manager at Index Exchange.

If you use `remote.html` in your AMP pages, you must add `ix` into the array that outlines the list of acceptable types. For example, `['doubleclick']` should be changed to `['doubleclick', 'ix']`. If you do not use `remote.html`, this step is not required.

Ad size is based on the `width` and `height` attributes of the `amp-ad` tag by default. Both width and height override attributes (`data-override-width` and `data-override-height`) and multi-size ads (via `data-multi-size`) are supported.

__Required:__

- `data-ix-id`
- `data-slot`

__Optional:__

- `data-ix-slot`
- `data-ix-timeout`

Additional parameters including `json` will be passed through in the resulting call to DFP. For details please see the [Doubleclick documentation](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/blob/master/ads/google/doubleclick.md).
