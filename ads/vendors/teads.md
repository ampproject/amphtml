## User Consent Integration

When [user consent](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/blob/master/extensions/amp-consent/amp-consent.md#blocking-behaviors) is required, Teads ad approaches user consent in the following ways:

-   `CONSENT_POLICY_STATE.SUFFICIENT`: Serve a personalized ad to the user.
-   `CONSENT_POLICY_STATE.INSUFFICIENT`: Serve a non-personalized ad to the user.
-   `CONSENT_POLICY_STATE.UNKNOWN_NOT_REQUIRED`: Serve a personalized ad to the user.
-   `CONSENT_POLICY_STATE.UNKNOWN`: Serve a non-personalized ad to the user..
