# Rubicon Project

If you want to serve ads via your Ad Server then there is no need to use the adapter when using Smart Tags. These can simply be served via your Ad Server in the normal fashion. You simply need to ensure that you are using secure tags (https).

The Rubicon Project adapter supports Smart Tags directly on the page.

**Please note that Fastlane is no longer supported.**

## Examples

### Smart Tag: Basic

```html
<amp-ad
  width="320"
  height="50"
  type="rubicon"
  data-method="smartTag"
  data-account="14062"
  data-site="70608"
  data-zone="335918"
  data-size="43"
>
</amp-ad>
```

#### Smart Tag: With additional targeting

```html
<amp-ad
  width="320"
  height="50"
  type="rubicon"
  data-method="smartTag"
  data-account="14062"
  data-site="70608"
  data-zone="335918"
  data-size="43"
  data-kw="amp"
  json='{"visitor":{"age":"18-24","gender":"male"},"inventory":{"section":"amp"}}'
>
</amp-ad>
```

### Configuration
