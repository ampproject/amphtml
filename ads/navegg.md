# Navegg

If you want to serve ads with Navegg data you need to use this adapter.

The Navegg adapter only supports Doubleclick for now.

## Example

```html
<amp-ad width=320 height=50
        type="navegg"
        data-acc="1"
        data-slot="/4119129/mobile_ad_banner"
        json='{"targeting":{"sport":["rugby","cricket"]}}'
    ></amp-ad>

```
