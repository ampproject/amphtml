# Navegg

If you want to serve ads with Navegg data you need to use this adapter.


## Example

```html
<amp-ad width=320 height=50
  type="navegg"
  data-acc="10"
  data-slot="/4119129/mobile_ad_banner"
  json='{"targeting":{"sport":["rugby","cricket"]}}'>
</amp-ad>

```

### Configuration

The Navegg adapter only supports Doubleclick for now.
For the most up-to-date list of Doubleclick supported parameters and usage please refer to Doubleclick reference guide [here](google/doubleclick.md).
To get Navegg integration working you only need to specify the 'data-acc' with your Navegg Account ID:
```html
  data-acc="NAVEGG_ACCOUNT_ID"
```
