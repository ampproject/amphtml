  data-eas-domain="eas4.emediate.eu"

```html
<amp-ad
  width="320"

  data-eas-cu="12345"

## Configuration

### Required parameters

- `data-eas-domain`: Specify your ad-server domain (e.g., `eas3.emediate.se`); If you're using a custom domain-name (like, `eas.somesite.com`) you should NOT use that one unless you already have an SSL-certificate installed on our ad servers.

### Optional parameters

- `data-eas-[parameter]`: Any ad-request parameter, like 'cu'.
