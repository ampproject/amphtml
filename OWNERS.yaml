# The below rule will be here only temporarily during the transition period
# while many owners files are being updated as contributors and teams notice
# which files are out of date. The `#` modifier means the owners bot will tag
# me on any PR that touches an owners file. This will allow me to verify
# syntax and semantics of all updates until the syntax check API for Travis to
# use is complete.

# Though this gives me the ability to approve changes to owners files, I do not
# currently have merge access; the owners check is currently non-blocking; and
# I run and maintain the owners bot application.

# TODO(#24685): Remove this once most owners files have been update and/or the
# Travis check is implemented.
