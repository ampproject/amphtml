# Video in AMP

Most video player components in AMP implement the [`VideoInterface`](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/blob/master/src/video-interface.js) API. This means
that a set of features is available in all of these components, either completely
or partially.

This document describes all the features (**work in progress, incomplete**) that
these players implement.

These players include:

- [amp-3q-player](https://www.ampproject.org/docs/reference/components/amp-3q-player)
- [amp-brid-player](https://www.ampproject.org/docs/reference/components/amp-brid-player)
- [amp-dailymotion](https://www.ampproject.org/docs/reference/components/amp-dailymotion)
- [amp-gfycat](https://www.ampproject.org/docs/reference/components/amp-gfycat)
- [amp-ima-video](https://www.ampproject.org/docs/reference/components/amp-ima-video)
- [amp-nexxtv-player](https://www.ampproject.org/docs/reference/components/amp-nexxtv-player)
- [amp-ooyala-player](https://www.ampproject.org/docs/reference/components/amp-ooyala-player)
- [amp-video](https://www.ampproject.org/docs/reference/components/amp-video)
- [amp-wistia-player](https://www.ampproject.org/docs/reference/components/amp-wistia-player)
- [amp-youtube](https://www.ampproject.org/docs/reference/components/amp-youtube)

## Analytics

See [video analytics](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/blob/master/extensions/amp-analytics/amp-video-analytics.md).

<a id="autoplay"></a>

## Autoplay

attribute: **`autoplay`**

If this attribute is present, and the browser supports autoplay:

- the video is automatically muted before autoplay starts
- when the video is scrolled out of view, the video is paused
- when the video is scrolled into view, the video resumes playback
- when the user taps the video, the video is unmuted
- if the user has interacted with the video (e.g., mutes/unmutes, pauses/resumes, etc.), and the video is scrolled in or out of view, the state of the video remains as how the user left it. For example, if the user pauses the video, then scrolls the video out of view and returns to the video, the video is still paused.

For an example, visit [AMP By Example](https://ampbyexample.com/components/amp-video/#autoplay).

<a id="rotate-to-fullscreen"></a>

## Rotate-to-fullscreen

attribute: **`rotate-to-fullscreen`**

**Availability: Experimental**

If this attribute is present and a video is playing manually (i.e. user initiated playback, or tapped on the video after autoplay), the video displays fullscreen after the user rotates their device into landscape mode, provided that the video is visible.

When multiple videos with the `rotate-to-fullscreen` attribute set are visible
at the same time, heuristics are employed to select which video to display in
fullscreen. These heuristics are applied as follows, in descending priority:

1. If a video is playing manually (i.e. user initiated playback, or tapped on the video after autoplay)
2. If the visible percentage of the video is higher.
3. If a video is closer to the center of the viewport.
4. Everything else failing, select the video that is closest to the top of the
viewport.
