# CORS Requests in AMP

Many AMP components and extensions take advantage of remote endpoints by using
Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) requests.  This document explains the key
aspects of using CORS in AMP.  To learn about CORS itself, see the
[W3 CORS Spec](https://www.w3.org/TR/cors/).

## Why do I need CORS for my own origin?

You might be confused as to why you'd need CORS for requests to your own origin,
let's dig into that.
 
AMP components that fetch dynamic data (e.g., amp-form, amp-list, etc.) make
CORS requests to remote endpoints to retrieve the data.  If your AMP page
includes such components, you'll need to handle CORS so that those requests do
not fail.
 
Let's illustrate this with an example:
 
Let's say you have an AMP page that lists products with prices. To update the
prices on the page, the user clicks a button, which retrieves the latest prices
from a JSON endpoint (done via the amp-list component). The JSON is on your
domain.
 
Okay, so the page is *on my domain* and the JSON is *on my domain*.  I see no
problem!
 
Ah, but how did your user get to your AMP page?  Is it a cached page they
access? It's quite likely that your user did not access your AMP page directly,
but instead they discovered your page through another platform. For example,
Google Search uses the Google AMP Cache to render AMP pages quickly; these are
cached pages that are served from the Google AMP Cache, which is a *different*
domain. When your user clicks the button to update the prices on your page, the
cached AMP page sends a request to your origin domain to get the prices, which
is a mismatch between origins (cache -> origin domain). To allow for such
cross-origin requests, you need to handle CORS, otherwise, the request fails.

    <img alt="CORS and Cache" src="https://www.ampproject.org/static/img/docs/CORS_with_Cache.png" />
  </noscript>
</amp-img>

**Okay, what should I do?**
 
1.  For AMP pages that fetch dynamic data, make sure you test the cached version
    of those pages; *don't just test on your own domain*.
2.  Follow the instructions in this document for handling CORS requests and
    responses.


## Utilizing cookies for CORS requests

Most AMP components that use CORS requests either automatically set the
[credentials mode](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-request-credentials-mode)
or allow the author to optionally enable it. For example, the
[`amp-list`](https://www.ampproject.org/docs/reference/components/amp-list)
component fetches dynamic content from a CORS JSON endpoint, and allows the
author to set the credential mode through the `credentials` attribute.

*Example: Including personalized content in an amp-list via cookies*

```html
<amp-list credentials="include" 
    src="<%host%>/json/product.json?clientId=CLIENT_ID(myCookieId)">
  <template type="amp-mustache">
    Your personal offer: ${{price}}
  </template>
</amp-list>
```

By specifying the credentials mode, the origin can include cookies in the CORS
request and also set cookies in the response (subject to
[third-party cookie restrictions](#third-party-cookie-restrictions)).

### Third-party cookie restrictions

The same third-party cookie restrictions specified in the browser also apply to
the credentialed CORS requests in AMP. These restrictions depend on the browser
and the platform, but for some browsers, the origin can only set cookies if the
user has previously visited the origin in a 1st-party (top) window. Or, in other
words, only after the user has directly visited the origin website itself. Given
this, a service accessed via CORS cannot assume that it will be able to set
cookies by default.

## CORS Security in AMP

The AMP CORS security protocol consists of three components: 
 
- The CORS `Origin` header
- The `AMP-Same-Origin` custom header
- Source origin restrictions via `__amp_source_origin`

### Ensuring secure requests

#### Verify the CORS Origin header

CORS endpoints receive the requesting origin via the `Origin` HTTP header.
Endpoints should restrict requests to allow only the following origins:
 
- **Google AMP Cache subdomain**: `https://<publisher's subdomain>.cdn.ampproject.org`
  (for example, `https://nytimes-com.cdn.ampproject.org`)
- **Google AMP Cache (legacy)**: `https://cdn.ampproject.org`
- **Cloudflare AMP Cache**: `https:<publisher's domain>.amp.cloudflare.com`
- The Publisherâ€™s own origins

For information on AMP Cache URL formats, see these resources:
- [Google AMP Cache Overview](https://developers.google.com/amp/cache/overview)
- [Cloudflare AMP Cache](https://amp.cloudflare.com/)

#### Allow the AMP-Same-Origin header

For same-origin requests where the `Origin` header is missing, AMP sets the
following custom header: 

```text
AMP-Same-Origin: true
```

This custom header is sent by the AMP Runtime when an XHR request is made on
the same origin (i.e., document served from a non-cache URL). Allow requests
that contain the `AMP-Same-Origin:true` header.

#### Restrict requests to source origins

In all fetch requests, the AMP Runtime passes the `"__amp_source_origin"` query
parameter, which contains the value of the source origin (for example,
`"https://publisher1.com"`). 
 
To restrict requests to only source origins, check that the value of the
`"__amp_source_origin"` parameter is within a set of the Publisher's own
origins. 
 
#### Verify state changing requests

**Important**: Perform these validation checks *before* you
process the request. This validation helps to provide protection against CSRF
attacks, and avoids processing untrusted sources requests.
 
Before processing requests that could change the state of your system (for
example, a user subscribes to or unsubscribes from a mailing list), check the
following:

**If the `Origin` header is set**:
 
1.  If the origin is not one of the following values, stop and return an error
    response:
    - `*.ampproject.org`
    - `*.amp.cloudflare.com`
    - the publisher's origin (aka yours)
2.  If the value of the `__amp_source_origin` query parameter is not the
    publisher's origin, stop and return an error response.
3.  If the two checks above pass, process the request. 

**If the `Origin header` is NOT set**:
 
1.  Verify that the request contains the `AMP-Same-Origin: true` header. If the
    request does not contain this header, stop and return an error response.
2.  Otherwise, process the request.

### Ensuring secure responses

The resulting HTTP response to a CORS request must contain the following
headers:
 
* **`Access-Control-Allow-Origin: <origin>`**
  * This header is a [W3 CORS Spec](https://www.w3.org/TR/cors/) requirement,
    where `origin` refers to the requesting origin that was allowed via the CORS
    `Origin` request header (for example, `"https://cdn.ampproject.org"`).
    Although the W3 CORS spec allows the value of `*` to be returned in the
    response, for improved security, you should validate and echo the value of
    the `"Origin"` header.

* **`AMP-Access-Control-Allow-Source-Origin: <source-origin>`**
  * This header allows the specified `source-origin` to read the authorization
    response. The `source-origin` is the value specified and verified in the
    `"__amp_source_origin"` URL parameter (for example,
    `"https://publisher1.com"`).
    
* **`Access-Control-Expose-Headers: AMP-Access-Control-Allow-Source-Origin`**
  * This header simply allows the CORS response to contain the
    `AMP-Access-Control-Allow-Source-Origin` header.
