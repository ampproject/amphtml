# AMP Cache Debugging

## Why is my doc broken on an AMP cache?

Valid AMP documents typically appear and behave the same on AMP Caches as they
do on the origin. However, there are some components and server configurations
that can be problematic.

If a particular document appears and behaves as expected on your origin, but not
when viewed via the cache ([how to map origin URLs to Google's AMP
Cache](https://developers.google.com/amp/cache/overview#amp-cache-url-format)),
try the following:

1. Open your browser's developer/error tools console, and resolve
   any errors or warnings that appear.
2. Run the document through [an AMP document validator](https://search.google.com/test/amp) and
   resolve any unexpected errors or warnings.

If you still have a problem after following these steps, check the table below.
