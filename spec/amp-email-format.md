AMP is a technology known for developing super fast web pages on mobile clients. AMP is a set of HTML tags backed by JavaScript that easily enables functionality with an added focus on performance and security. There are [AMP components](https://amp.dev/documentation/components.html) for everything from carousels, to responsive form elements, to retrieving fresh content from remote endpoints.

The AMP for Email format provides a subset of AMP components that you can use in email messages. Recipients of AMP emails can view and interact with the AMP components directly in the email.


## The AMP for Email Format

### Required markup

The following code represents the minimum amount of markup that makes up a valid AMP email message:

```html
<!doctype html>
<html âš¡4email>
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <style amp4email-boilerplate>body{visibility:hidden}</style>
  <script async src="https://cdn.ampproject.org/v0.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
Hello, world.
</body>
</html>
```

An AMP email message MUST

- <a name="dctp"></a>start with the doctype `<!doctype html>`. [ðŸ”—](#dctp)
- <a name="ampd"></a>contain a top-level `<html âš¡4email>` tag (`<html amp4email>` is accepted as well). [ðŸ”—](#ampd)
- <a name="crps"></a>contain `<head>` and `<body>` tags (They are optional in HTML). [ðŸ”—](#crps)
- <a name="chrs"></a>contain a `<meta charset="utf-8">` tag as the first child of their head tag. [ðŸ”—](#chrs)
- <a name="scrpt"></a>contain a `<script async src="https://cdn.ampproject.org/v0.js"></script>` tag inside their head tag. [ðŸ”—](#scrpt)
- <a name="boilerplate"></a>contain amp4email boilerplate (`<style amp4email-boilerplate>body{visibility:hidden}</style>`) inside their head tag to initially hide the content until AMP JS is loaded. [ðŸ”—](#boilerplate)

## AMP Components

The following is the list of [AMP components](https://amp.dev/documentation/components.html?format=email) that are currently supported in AMP email messages. The components are grouped into the following categories:

* [Dynamic Content](#dynamic-content)
* [Layout](#layout)
* [Media](#media)

### Dynamic Content

| Element | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| [`<amp-form>`](https://amp.dev/documentation/components/reference/amp-form.html) | Form element. The action-xhr attribute must be used in place of the regular action attribute. Can be used in conjunction with `<template type="amp-mustache">` to render a response. |
| [`<amp-selector>`](https://amp.dev/documentation/components/reference/amp-selector.html) | A multi-select widget for use within a form. |
| [`<amp-bind>` and `<amp-state>`](https://amp.dev/documentation/components/reference/amp-bind.html) | Simple scripting language in AMP that allows the manipulation of a state machine for interactions between elements. Can also be used to add behavior on certain events.<br><br>`<amp-state>` is used to remotely fetch the initial state machine values.<br><br>**Note:** It is prohibited to bind to `[href]` or `[src]`. It is also prohibited to use the `AMP.print`, `AMP.navigateTo` and `AMP.goBack` actions. |
| [`<amp-list>`](https://amp.dev/documentation/components/reference/amp-list.html) | Remotely fetches JSON data that will be rendered by an [`<amp-mustache>`](https://amp.dev/documentation/components/reference/amp-mustache.html).<br><br>**Note:** Binding to the `[src]` attribute is not allowed. Including user credentials with `credentials="include"` is also prohibited. |
| [`<template type="amp-mustache">`](https://amp.dev/documentation/components/reference/amp-mustache.html) | A Mustache template markup to render the results of an `amp-list` call. |

### Layout

| Element | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| [layout attributes](https://amp.dev/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/learn/amp-html-layout/index.html#layout-attributes)| Layout behavior is determined by the layout attribute. |
| [`<amp-accordion>`](https://amp.dev/documentation/components/reference/amp-accordion.html)| A UI element that facilitates showing/hiding different sections. |
| [`<amp-carousel>`](https://amp.dev/documentation/components/reference/amp-carousel.html) | A carousel UI component. |
| [`<amp-sidebar>`](https://amp.dev/documentation/components/reference/amp-sidebar.html) | A sidebar for navigational purposes. |
| [`<amp-image-lightbox>`](https://amp.dev/documentation/components/reference/amp-image-lightbox.html) | A lightbox for containing images. |
| [`<amp-lightbox>`](https://amp.dev/documentation/components/reference/amp-lightbox.html) | A lightbox for containing content. |
| [`<amp-fit-text>`](https://amp.dev/documentation/components/reference/amp-fit-text.html) | A helper component for fitting text within a certain area. |
| [`<amp-timeago>`](https://amp.dev/documentation/components/reference/amp-timeago.html) | Provides a convenient way of rendering timestamps. |

### Media

| Element | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| [`<amp-img>`](https://amp.dev/documentation/components/reference/amp-img.html) | An AMP component that replaces `<img>`.<br><br>**Note:** Binding to `[src]` is not allowed. |
| [`<amp-anim>`](https://amp.dev/documentation/components/reference/amp-anim.html) | Embeds GIF files.<br><br>**Note:** Binding to `[src]` is not allowed. |

## CSS requirements

### Specifying CSS in an AMP document

All CSS in any AMP document must be included in a `<style amp-custom>` tag within the header or as inline `style` attributes.

```html
...
<style amp-custom>
  /* any custom styles go here. */
  body {
    background-color: white;
  }
  amp-img {
    border: 5px solid black;
  }
  amp-img.grey-placeholder {
    background-color: grey;
  }
</style>
...
</head>
```

Note: The entire `<style>` tag cannot exceed 50,000 bytes. The validator will check for this.

### CSS Restrictions
The AMP4EMAIL validator spec does not contain CSS restrictions beyond the [standard AMP CSS restrictions](https://amp.dev/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/develop/style_and_layout/style_pages.html). However, email clients may have their own CSS restrictions.

For example, in Gmail, the allowed list of CSS properties and values can be found at [Gmail Supported CSS Properties & Media Queries](https://developers.google.com/gmail/design/reference/supported_css).


## Document dimensions

* **Optimal width**: 800px or less (any wider and content may be unexpectedly truncated on some clients).

* **Height**: variable, the client allows the user to scroll through the content.

## Validation

To ensure your email messages meet the strict criteria for the AMP for Email format, you can use AMP's existing validation tools.

See [Validate AMP Email](https://amp.dev/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/develop/validate_emails.html) for more information.

## Privacy and Security

### Tracking email opens and interaction
AMPHTML allows tracking email opens with pixel tracking techniques, same as regular HTML emails. Any user-initiated requests for data from external services will also indicate the user is interacting with the message. Email clients may offer their users the ability to disable loading remote images, and other external requests.


### AMP-specific analytics
The following AMP-specific analytic techniques are not supported:

*   [AMP `CLIENT_ID`](https://amp.dev/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/optimize-measure/configure-analytics/analytics_basics.html#user-identification)
*   [`amp-analytics`](https://amp.dev/documentation/components/reference/amp-analytics.html)
*   [`amp-pixel`](https://amp.dev/documentation/components/reference/amp-pixel.html)
*   [AMP Variable Substitution](https://amp.dev/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/optimize-measure/configure-analytics/analytics_basics.html#variable-substitution)

### Replying/forwarding semantics

The email client strips out the `text/x-amp-html` part of the MIME tree when a user replies to or forwards an AMP email message. This is why it is important that an email provide alternative content in the HTML part.


### The amp-carousel

Requests for images in the [`<amp-carousel>`](https://amp.dev/documentation/components/reference/amp-carousel.html) can indicate to the sender that the user is interacting with the message.


## Examples

This section provides some [AMP for Email code examples](https://amp.dev/documentation/examples.html?format=email).

### Basic usage of `<amp-list>`

The following is a fictional email that includes an updated list of featured products retrieved from an endpoint. This example shows the basic usage of [`<amp-list>`](https://amp.dev/documentation/components/reference/amp-list.html).

```html
<!doctype html>
<html âš¡4email>
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <script async src="https://cdn.ampproject.org/v0.js"></script>
  <script async custom-element="amp-list" src="https://cdn.ampproject.org/v0/amp-list-0.1.js"></script>
  <script async custom-template="amp-mustache" src="https://cdn.ampproject.org/v0/amp-mustache-0.2.js"></script>
  <style amp4email-boilerplate>body{visibility:hidden}</style>
</head>
<body>
  Check out these latest deals from our store!
  <amp-list src="https://ampbyexample.com/json/cart.json" layout="fixed-height" height="80">
    <template type="amp-mustache">
      <div id="cart">
        <!-- These items (and their prices) can be updated dynamically. -->
        {{#cart_items}}
        <div class="cart-item">
            <span>{{name}}</span>
            <span>{{price}}</span>
          </div>
        {{/cart_items}}
        {{^cart_items}}
          There are no featured products available. Please check back again later.
        {{/cart_items}}
      </div>
    </template>
  </amp-list>
</body>
</html>
```

### Basic usage of `<amp-bind>`

The following is a fictional email that shows interactivity features by using [`<amp-bind>`](https://amp.dev/documentation/components/reference/amp-bind.html).

```html
<!doctype html>
<html âš¡4email>
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <script async src="https://cdn.ampproject.org/v0.js"></script>
  <script async custom-element="amp-bind" src="https://cdn.ampproject.org/v0/amp-bind-0.1.js"></script>
  <style amp4email-boilerplate>body{visibility:hidden}</style>
  <style amp-custom>
    .red { background-color: red; }
    .blue { background-color: blue; }
    .yellow { background-color: yellow; }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <p [class]="state.color" class="yellow" [text]="'The current color is ' + state.color + '.'">
    The current color is yellow
  </p>
  <button on="tap:AMP.setState({state: {color: 'red'}})">
    Set color to red
  </button>
  <button on="tap:AMP.setState({state: {color: 'blue'}})">
    Set color to blue
  </button>
</body>
</html>
```

## Adding AMP to existing emails

Email is structured as a [MIME tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIME). This MIME tree contains the message body and any attachments to the email.

Embedding AMP within an email is simple, add a new MIME part with a content type of `text/x-amp-html` as a descendant of `multipart/alternative`. It should live alongside the existing `text/html` or `text/plain` parts. This ensures that the email message works on all clients.

```html
<amp-img alt="AMP for Email MIME Parts Diagram"
    layout="responsive"
    width="752" height="246"
    src="https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/raw/master/spec/img/amp-email-mime-parts.png">
  <noscript>
    <img alt="AMP for Email MIME Parts Diagram" src="img/amp-email-mime-parts.png" />
  </noscript>
</amp-img>
```

Important things to note:

- The `text/x-amp-html` part must be nested under a `multipart/alternative` node, it will not be recognized by the email client otherwise.

- Some email clients[[1]](https://openradar.appspot.com/radar?id=6054696888303616) will only render the last MIME part, so we recommend placing the `text/x-amp-html` MIME part *before* the `text/html` MIME part.

See the following example:

```
From:  Person A <persona@gmail.com>
To: Person B <personb@gmail.com>
Subject: An AMP email!
Content-Type: multipart/alternative; boundary="001a114634ac3555ae05525685ae"

--001a114634ac3555ae05525685ae
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="UTF-8"; format=flowed; delsp=yes

Hello World in plain text!

--001a114634ac3555ae05525685ae
Content-Type: text/x-amp-html; charset="UTF-8"

<!doctype html>
<html âš¡4email>
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <style amp4email-boilerplate>body{visibility:hidden}</style>
  <script async src="https://cdn.ampproject.org/v0.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
Hello World in AMP!
</body>
</html>
--001a114634ac3555ae05525685ae--
Content-Type: text/html; charset="UTF-8"

<span>Hello World in HTML!</span>
--001a114634ac3555ae05525685ae
```
