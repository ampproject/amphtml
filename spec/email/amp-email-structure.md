# Structure and rendering of AMP emails

Email is structured as a [MIME tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIME). This MIME tree contains the message body and any attachments to the email.

To embed AMP within an email, add a new MIME part with a content type of `text/x-amp-html` as a descendant of `multipart/alternative`. It should live alongside the existing `text/html` or `text/plain` parts. This ensures that the email message works on all clients.

For more information about the `multipart/alternative` subtype, refer to [RFC 1521, section 7.2.3](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1521#section-7.2.3).

## Additional information

The `text/x-amp-html` part must be nested under a `multipart/alternative` node.
An email cannot have more than one `text/x-amp-html` part inside a `multipart/alternative` node.

The `multipart/alternative` must contain at least one non-AMP (`text/plain` or `text/html`) node in addition to the
`text/x-amp-html` node. This will be displayed to users whose email clients don't support AMP or who opted out via
their email provider's settings.

Note: Some email clients[[1]](https://openradar.appspot.com/radar?id=6054696888303616) will only render the last MIME part,
so we recommend placing the `text/x-amp-html` MIME part _before_ the `text/html` MIME part.

### Replying/forwarding semantics

The email client strips out the `text/x-amp-html` part of the MIME tree when a user replies to or forwards an AMP email message.

### Expiry

The email client may stop displaying the AMP part of an email after a set period of time, e.g. 30 days. In this
case, emails will display the `text/html` or `text/plain` part.
