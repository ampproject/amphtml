# Actions and Events in AMP

The `on` attribute is used to install event handlers on elements. The events that are supported depend on the element.

The value for the syntax is a simple domain specific language of the form:

```javascript
eventName:targetId[.methodName[(arg1=value, arg2=value)]]
```

Here's what each part of this means:
**eventName**
__required__
This is the name of the event that an element exposes. 

**targetId**
__required__
This is the DOM id for the element you'd like to execute an action on in response to the event. In the following example, the `targetId` is the DOM id of the `amp-lightbox` target, `photo-slides`.

```html
<amp-lightbox id="photo-slides"></amp-lightbox>
<button on="tap:photo-slides">Show Images</button>
```

**methodName**
__optional__ for elements with default actions
This is the method that the target element (referenced by `targetId`) exposes and you'd like to execute when the event is triggered.

AMP has a concept of a default action that elements can implement. So when omitting the `methodName` AMP will execute that default method.

**arg=value**
__optional__
Some actions, if documented, may accept arguments. The arguments are defined between parentheses in `key=value` notation. The accepted values are:
 - simple unquoted strings: `simple-value`;
 - quoted strings: `"string value"` or `'string value'`;
 - boolean values: `true` or `false`;
 - numbers: `11` or `1.1`.

## Handling Multiple Events 
You can listen to multiple events on an element by separating the two events with a semicolon `;`.

Example: `on="submit-success:lightbox1;submit-error:lightbox2"`

## Globally defined Events and Actions
Currently AMP defines `tap` event globally that you can listen to on any HTML element (including amp-elements).

AMP also defines a `hide` action globally that you can trigger on any HTML element.

For example, the following is possible in AMP.

```html
<div id="warning-message">Warning...</div>

<button on="tap:warning-message.hide">Cool, thanks!</button>
```
