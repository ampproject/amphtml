# AMP CSS classes

This document describes AMP CSS classes prefixed with `amp-`.  These classes allow for customizations of some features of AMP runtime and extensions.

## Input mode classes

AMP provides the following CSS classes that are set on the document's `body` to assist with some typical desktop and mobile cases:

* `amp-mode-touch`: This class is set when AMP detects touch input.
* `amp-mode-mouse`: This class is set when AMP detects mouse input.
* `amp-mode-keyboard-active`: This class is set when AMP detects that the keyboard is active.


## Component-specific classes

See the *Styling* section in the AMP component's reference documentation to learn about specific `amp-` classes used for that component (for example, `amp-carousel-button-prev` in [`amp-carousel`](https://www.ampproject.org/docs/reference/components/amp-carousel#styling)).
