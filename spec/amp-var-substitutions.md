# AMP HTML URL Variable Substitutions

## Overview

Some components such as [`amp-pixel`](../builtins/amp-pixel.md) and
[`amp-list`](../extensions/amp-list/README.md) allow variables to be substituted
in the relevant URLs. AMP provides a number of standard variable substitutions and
allows each component to add their own. The rest of this document talks about
the variables supported by the platform.

## Page and Content

### AMPDOC_HOST

Use the special string `AMPDOC_HOST` to add the AMP document's URL host.

For instance:
```html
<amp-pixel src="https://foo.com/pixel?host=AMPDOC_HOST"></amp-pixel>
```
may make a request to something like `https://foo.com/pixel?host=example.com`.

### AMPDOC_URL

Use the special string `AMPDOC_URL` to add the AMP document's URL.

For instance:
```html
<amp-pixel src="https://foo.com/pixel?ref=AMPDOC_URL"></amp-pixel>
```
may make a request to something like `https://foo.com/pixel?ref=https%3A%2F%2Fexample.com%2F`.

### CANONICAL_HOST

Use the special string `CANONICAL_HOST` to add the canonical URL's host of the current document to the URL

For instance:
```html
<amp-pixel src="https://foo.com/pixel?host=CANONICAL_HOST"></amp-pixel>
```
may make a request to something like `https://foo.com/pixel?host=pinterest.com`.

### CANONICAL_PATH

Use the special string `CANONICAL_PATH` to add the canonical URL's path of the current document to the URL

For instance:
```html
<amp-pixel src="https://foo.com/pixel?path=CANONICAL_PATH"></amp-pixel>
```
may make a request to something like `https://foo.com/pixel?path=%2Fpage1.html`.

### CANONICAL_URL

Use the special string `CANONICAL_URL` to add the canonical URL of the current document to the URL

For instance:
```html
<amp-pixel src="https://foo.com/pixel?href=CANONICAL_URL"></amp-pixel>
```
may make a request to something like `https://foo.com/pixel?href=https%3A%2F%2Fpinterest.com%2F`.

### DOCUMENT_REFERRER

Use the special string `DOCUMENT_REFERRER` to add the current document's referrer to the URL.

For instance:
```html
<amp-pixel src="https://foo.com/pixel?referrer=DOCUMENT_REFERRER"></amp-pixel>
```

### TITLE

Use the special string `TITLE` to add the title of the current document to the URL

For instance:
```html
<amp-pixel src="https://foo.com/pixel?title=TITLE"></amp-pixel>
```
may make a request to something like `https://foo.com/pixel?title=Breaking%20News`.

## Performance

### CONTENT_LOAD_TIME

Provides the time the page takes to fire the `DOMContentLoaded` event from the time the previous page is unloaded. The value is in milliseconds.

For instance:
```html
<amp-pixel src="https://foo.com/pixel?contentLoadTime=CONTENT_LOAD_TIME"></amp-pixel>
```

### DOMAIN_LOOKUP_TIME

Provides the time it took to perform the DNS lookup for the current page. The value is in milliseconds.

For instance:
```html
<amp-pixel src="https://foo.com/pixel?domainLookupTime=DOMAIN_LOOKUP_TIME"></amp-pixel>
```

### DOM_INTERACTIVE_TIME

Provides the time the page to become interactive from the time the previous page
is unloaded. The value is in milliseconds.

For instance:
```html
<amp-pixel src="https://foo.com/pixel?domInteractiveTime=DOM_INTERACTIVE_TIME"></amp-pixel>
```

### PAGE_DOWNLOAD_TIME

Provides the time between receiving the first and the last byte of response. The value is in milliseconds.

For instance:
```html
<amp-pixel src="https://foo.com/pixel?pageDownloadTime=PAGE_DOWNLOAD_TIME"></amp-pixel>
```

### PAGE_LOAD_TIME

Provides the time taken to load the whole page. The value is calculated from the time `unload` event handler on previous page ends to the time `load` event for the current page is fired. If there is no previous page, the duration starts from the time the user agent is ready to fetch the document using an HTTP requesti. The value is in milliseconds.

For instance:
```html
<amp-pixel src="https://foo.com/pixel?pageLoadTime=PAGE_LOAD_TIME"></amp-pixel>
```

### REDIRECT_TIME

Provides the time taken to complete all the redirects before the request for the current page is made. The value is in milliseconds.

For instance:
```html
<amp-pixel src="https://foo.com/pixel?redirectTime=REDIRECT_TIME"></amp-pixel>
```

### SERVER_RESPONSE_TIME

Provides the time taken by the server to start sending the response after it starts receiving the request. The value is in milliseconds.

For instance:
```html
<amp-pixel src="https://foo.com/pixel?serverResponseTime=SERVER_RESPONSE_TIME"></amp-pixel>
```

### TCP_CONNECT_TIME

Provides the time it took for HTTP connection to be setup. The duration includes connection handshake time and SOCKS authentication. The value is in milliseconds.

For instance:
```html
<amp-pixel src="https://foo.com/pixel?tcpConnectTime=TCP_CONNECT_TIME"></amp-pixel>
```

## Miscellaneous

### CLIENT_ID

Use the special string `CLIENT_ID` to add a per document-source-origin (The origin of the website where you publish your AMP doc) and user identifier. The `CLIENT_ID` will be the same for the same user if they visit again within one year. It should behave roughly similar to a cookie storing a session id for one year. If the AMP document is not served through the AMP CDN, the `CLIENT_ID` will be replaced with a cookie of the name of the cid scope below. If it is not present a cookie will be set with the same name. These cookies will always have the prefix "amp-" followed by a random base64 encoded string.

Please see below the required and optional arguments you may
pass into `CLIENT_ID` like a function. (spaces between arguments and values are not allowed)

arguments:
  - `cid scope` (Required) - Name of the fallback cookie when the document
    is not served by an AMP proxy.
  - `amp-user-notification id` (Optional) - Optionally make the `CLIENT_ID`
    substitution be dependent on the dismissal of a user notification shown to the visitor
    of the page.

For instance:
```html
<amp-pixel src="https://foo.com/pixel?cid=CLIENT_ID(cid-scope-cookie-fallback-name)"></amp-pixel>


<amp-user-notification
    layout=nodisplay
    id="user-consent"
    data-show-if-href="https://foo.com/api/show"
    data-dismiss-href="https://foo.com/api/dismissed">
    This site uses cookies to personalize content.
    <a href="">Learn more.</a>
   <button on="tap:user-consent.dismiss">I accept</button>
</amp-user-notification>

<!-- cid is not provided until `user-consent` is dismissed -->
<amp-pixel src="https://foo.com/pixel?cid=CLIENT_ID(cid-scope-cookie-fallback-name,user-consent-id)"></amp-pixel>
```

### PAGE_VIEW_ID

Contains a string that is intended to be random and likely to be unique per URL, user and day.

### RANDOM

Use the special string `RANDOM` to add a random number to the URL if required.

For instance:
```html
<amp-pixel src="https://foo.com/pixel?RANDOM"></amp-pixel>
```
may make a request to something like `https://foo.com/pixel?0.8390278471201` where the $RANDOM value is randomly generated upon each impression.

### TIMESTAMP

Use the special string `TIMESTAMP` to add the current number of seconds that
have elapsed since 1970. (Epoch time)

For instance:
```html
<amp-pixel src="https://foo.com/pixel?timestamp=TIMESTAMP"></amp-pixel>
```
