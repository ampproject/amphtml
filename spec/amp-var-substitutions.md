# AMP HTML URL Variable Substitutions

## Overview

Some components such as [`amp-pixel`](../builtins/amp-pixel.md) and
[`amp-list`](../extensions/amp-list/amp-list.md) allow variables to be substituted
in the relevant URLs. AMP provides a number of standard variable substitutions and
allows each component to add their own. The rest of this document talks about
the variables supported by the platform.

Anchor href's that are the target (or have a child who is the target) of a click
are synchronously expanded.  Variables below that are asynchronous by nature
are replaced with empty string to ensure page navigation is not delayed.  If
the navigation is prevented, the href is still updated however later clicks
will still update to the most current values of the variables.  Note that some
variables will not allow for expansion for A4A creatives.  Specifics will be
addressed at a later time.

## Page and Content

### AMPDOC_HOST

Use the special string `AMPDOC_HOST` to add the AMP document's URL host.

For instance:
```html
<amp-pixel src="https://foo.com/pixel?host=AMPDOC_HOST"></amp-pixel>
```
may make a request to something like `https://foo.com/pixel?host=example.com:8080`.

### AMPDOC_HOSTNAME

Use the special string `AMPDOC_HOSTNAME` to add the AMP document's URL hostname.

For instance:
```html
<amp-pixel src="https://foo.com/pixel?hostname=AMPDOC_HOSTNAME"></amp-pixel>
```
may make a request to something like `https://foo.com/pixel?hostname=example.com`.

### AMPDOC_URL

Use the special string `AMPDOC_URL` to add the AMP document's URL.

For instance:
```html
<amp-pixel src="https://foo.com/pixel?ref=AMPDOC_URL"></amp-pixel>

For instance:
```html
<amp-pixel src="https://foo.com/pixel?availScreenHeight=AVAILABLE_SCREEN_HEIGHT"></amp-pixel>
```

### AVAILABLE_SCREEN_WIDTH

```html
<amp-pixel src="https://foo.com/pixel?availScreenWidth=AVAILABLE_SCREEN_WIDTH"></amp-pixel>
```

### BROWSER_LANGUAGE

Example value: `1460655576651`

### CLIENT_ID

Use the special string `CLIENT_ID` to add a per document-source-origin (The origin of the website where you publish your AMP doc) and user identifier. The `CLIENT_ID` will be the same for the same user if they visit again within one year. It should behave roughly similar to a cookie storing a session id for one year. If the AMP document is not served through the Google AMP Cache, the `CLIENT_ID` will be replaced with a cookie of the name of the cid scope below. If it is not present a cookie will be set with the same name. These cookies will always have the prefix "amp-" followed by a random base64 encoded string.

Please see below the required and optional arguments you may
pass into `CLIENT_ID` like a function. (spaces between arguments and values are not allowed)

arguments:
  - `cid scope` (Required) - Name of the fallback cookie when the document
    is not served by an AMP proxy.
  - `amp-user-notification id` (Optional) - Optionally make the `CLIENT_ID`
    substitution be dependent on the dismissal of a user notification shown to the visitor
    of the page.

For instance:
```html
<amp-pixel src="https://foo.com/pixel?cid=CLIENT_ID(cid-scope-cookie-fallback-name)"></amp-pixel>


<amp-user-notification
    layout=nodisplay
    id="user-consent"
    data-show-if-href="https://foo.com/api/show"
    data-dismiss-href="https://foo.com/api/dismissed">
    This site uses cookies to personalize content.
    <a href="">Learn more.</a>
   <button on="tap:user-consent.dismiss">I accept</button>
</amp-user-notification>

<!-- cid is not provided until `user-consent` is dismissed -->
<amp-pixel src="https://foo.com/pixel?cid=CLIENT_ID(cid-scope-cookie-fallback-name,user-consent-id)"></amp-pixel>
```

### QUERY_PARAM

Provides access to query string params.

arguments:
  - `param` (Required) - The key for the query string parameter to be inserted
  - `defaultValue` - The value to use if the provide key is not present on the query string. Defaults to ""

For instance:
```html
<amp-pixel src="https://foo.com/pixel?bar=QUERY_PARAM(baz,biz)"</amp-pixel>
```

If a query string parameter baz is provided then the corresponding value will be insterted into the pixel src, if no, the default "biz" will be used.

### PAGE_VIEW_ID

Contains a string that is intended to be random and likely to be unique per URL, user and day.

### RANDOM

Use the special string `RANDOM` to add a random number to the URL if required.

For instance:
```html
<amp-pixel src="https://foo.com/pixel?RANDOM"></amp-pixel>
```
may make a request to something like `https://foo.com/pixel?0.8390278471201` where the $RANDOM value is randomly generated upon each impression.

### TIMESTAMP

Use the special string `TIMESTAMP` to add the current number of seconds that
have elapsed since 1970. (Epoch time)

For instance:
```html
<amp-pixel src="https://foo.com/pixel?timestamp=TIMESTAMP"></amp-pixel>
```

### TOTAL_ENGAGED_TIME

Provides the total time the user has been enagaged with the page since the page
first became visible in the viewport. Total engaged time will be 0 until the
page first becomes visible. This variable requires the [amp-analytics](../extensions/amp-analytics/amp-analytics.md) extension to be present on the page.

## Access

Access variables are described in [amp-access-analytics.md](../extensions/amp-access/amp-access-analytics.md).
