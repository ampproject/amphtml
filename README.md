# Storyteller AMP âš¡

## Running The Project

- Clone the repo and `cd` to the root directory
- Run `amp` to start run the project
- Open `http://localhost:8000` in a browser to view the site with examples for each component. These can be used for testing any changes you make to AMP components

## Making Changes

- Most changes will be made to components in `src/extensions/amp-story` or in `src\amp-story-player\amp-story-player-impl.js`
- Any changes you make can be tested using the component examples
- Changes relating to stories/story player can be tested at usually `http://localhost:8000/examples/amp-story/player-local-stories.html`. This example uses stories located in the `examples/amp-story` folder. These stories can be edited iof different features need to be tested.
- Changes should also be tested on the Web SDK demo site. This should be done by merging the changes to main and testing on the demo site

## CI/CD

- Deploys to `main` will trigger the CI to build a new version
- This build will then be automatically deployed to both dev and staging environments
- Once the build has been tested on dev and staging, it can be manually deployed to prod
