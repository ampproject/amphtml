# AMP HTML ⚡

[AMP HTML](https://www.ampproject.org/docs/get_started/about-amp.html) is a way to build web pages that render with reliable and fast performance. It is our attempt at fixing what many perceive as painfully slow page load times – especially when reading content on the mobile web.  AMP HTML is built on existing web technologies; an AMP page will load (quickly) in any modern browser.

You can learn more at [ampproject.org](https://www.ampproject.org/) including [what AMP is](https://www.ampproject.org/learn/about-amp/), [how it works](https://www.ampproject.org/learn/how-amp-works/) and the importance of [validation in AMP](https://www.ampproject.org/docs/guides/validate).  You can also walk through [creating an AMP page](https://www.ampproject.org/docs/get_started/create) and read through the [reference docs](https://www.ampproject.org/docs/reference/components).
