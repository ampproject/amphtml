# AMP HTML ⚡

[![Renovate enabled](https://img.shields.io/badge/renovate-enabled-brightgreen.svg)](https://renovateapp.com/)

[AMP HTML](https://amp.dev) is a way to build web pages that render with reliable and fast performance. It is our attempt at fixing what many perceive as painfully slow page load times – especially when reading content on the mobile web.  AMP HTML is built on existing web technologies; an AMP page will load (quickly) in any modern browser.

You can learn more at [amp.dev](https://amp.dev) including [how AMP works](https://amp.dev/about/how-amp-works) and the importance of [validation in AMP](https://amp.dev/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/learn/validation-workflow/validate_amp).  You can also walk through [creating an AMP page](https://amp.dev/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/start/create/basic_markup) and read through the [reference docs](https://amp.dev/documentation/components/).
