# Validator Release Schedule

A new release of the [AMPHTML Validator](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/tree/main/validator#amp-html--validator) is pushed to [cdn.ampproject.org/v0/validator.js](https://cdn.ampproject.org/v0/validator.js) roughly every week and typically on Tuesdays.

The release of [AMP](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml#amp-) has it's own [Release Schedule](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/blob/main/docs/release-schedule.md).

### Release Freezes

There are occasions when we will skip a release of the AMPHTML Validator to production, known as a release freeze.

A release freeze may happen due to:

-   Times when there are not enough people available to push the AMPHTML Validator to production and monitor it. Currently, most of the people performing releases are based in the United States, so this will usually be the weeks of the major US holidays:
    -   Independence Day (July 4)
    -   Thanksgiving (fourth Thursday in November)
    -   Between Christmas (25 December) and New Year's Eve/Day (December 31/January 1)

In all cases, except emergencies, the release freezes will be announced at least one month in advance.

Note that unless otherwise announced a release freeze does not imply a code freeze. Code may still be written, reviewed and merged during a release freeze.
