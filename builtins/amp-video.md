## Behavior

The `amp-video` component loads the video resource specified by its `src` attribute lazily, at a time determined by the runtime. It can be controlled much the same way as a standard HTML5 `video` tag.

The `amp-video` component HTML accepts up to three unique types of HTML nodes as children - `source` tags, a placeholder for before the video starts, and a fallback if the browser doesn’t support HTML5 video.

`source` tag children can be used in the same way as the standard `video` tag, to specify different source files to play.

One or zero immediate child nodes can have the `placeholder` attribute. If present, this node and its children form a placeholder that will display instead of the video. A click or tap anywhere inside of the `amp-video` container will replace the placeholder with the video itself.

One or zero immediate child nodes can have the `fallback` attribute. If present, this node and its children form the content that will be displayed if HTML5 video is not supported on the user’s browser.

For example:
```html
<amp-video width=400 height=300 src="https://yourhost.com/videos/myvideo.mp4"
    poster="myvideo-poster.jpg">
  <div fallback>
    <p>Your browser doesn’t support HTML5 video</p>
  </div>
  <source type="video/mp4" src="foo.mp4">
  <source type="video/webm" src="foo.webm">
</amp-video>
```

## Attributes

**src**

Required if no &lt;source&gt; children are present. Must be HTTPS.

**poster**

The image for the frame to be displayed before video playback has started. By
default the first frame is displayed.

**autoplay**

If present, the video will automatically start playback once rendered (if autoplay is supported by the browser).

**controls**

Similar to the `video` tag `controls` attribute - if present, the browser offers controls to allow the user to control video playback.

**loop**

If present, will automatically loop the video back to the start upon reaching the end.

**muted**

If present, will mute the audio by default.

## Validation

See [amp-video rules](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/blob/master/validator/validator-main.protoascii) in the AMP validator specification.
