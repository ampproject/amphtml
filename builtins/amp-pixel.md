## Behavior

The `amp-pixel` component behaves like a simple tracking pixel `img`. It takes a single URL, but provides variables that can be replaced by the component in the URL string when making the request. See the `src` attribute for more information.

## Attributes

**src** (required)

A simple URL to send a GET request to when the tracking pixel is loaded.

## Substitutions

The `amp-pixel` allows all standard URL variable substitutions.
See [Substitutions Guide](../spec/amp-var-substitutions.md) for more info.

For instance:
```html
<amp-pixel src="https://foo.com/pixel?RANDOM"></amp-pixel>
```
may make a request to something like `https://foo.com/pixel?0.8390278471201` where the RANDOM value is randomly generated upon each impression.

## Styling

`amp-pixel` should not be styled.

## Validation

See [amp-pixel rules](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/blob/master/validator/validator-main.protoascii) in the AMP validator specification.
