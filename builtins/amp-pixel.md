### <a name="amp-pixel"></a> `amp-pixel`

The `amp-pixel` element is meant to be used as a typical tracking pixel - to count page views.

#### Behavior

The `amp-pixel` component behaves like a simple tracking pixel `img`. It takes a single URL, but provides variables that can be replaced by the component in the URL string when making the request. See the `src` attribute for more information.

#### Attributes

**src**

A simple URL to send a GET request to when the tracking pixel is loaded.

The variables listed under the Substitutions paragraph can be used to interpolate certain values into the pixel URL.

#### Substitutions

**RANDOM**

Use the special string `RANDOM` to add a random number to the URL if required.

For instance:
```html
<amp-pixel src="https://foo.com/pixel?RANDOM"></amp-pixel>
```
may make a request to something like `https://foo.com/pixel?0.8390278471201` where the $RANDOM value is randomly generated upon each impression.

**CANONICAL_URL**

Use the special string `CANONICAL_URL` to add the canonical URL of the current document to the URL

For instance:
```html
<amp-pixel src="https://foo.com/pixel?href=CANONICAL_URL"></amp-pixel>
```
may make a request to something like `https://foo.com/pixel?href=https%3A%2F%2Fpinterest.com%2F`.

**CANONICAL_HOST**

Use the special string `CANONICAL_HOST` to add the canonical URL's host of the current document to the URL

For instance:
```html
<amp-pixel src="https://foo.com/pixel?host=CANONICAL_HOST"></amp-pixel>
```
may make a request to something like `https://foo.com/pixel?host=pinterest.com`.

**CANONICAL_PATH**

Use the special string `CANONICAL_PATH` to add the canonical URL's path of the current document to the URL

For instance:
```html
<amp-pixel src="https://foo.com/pixel?path=CANONICAL_PATH"></amp-pixel>
```
may make a request to something like `https://foo.com/pixel?path=%2Fpage1.html`.

**DOCUMENT_REFERRER**

Use the special string `DOCUMENT_REFERRER` to add the current document's referrer to the URL.

For instance:
```html
<amp-pixel src="https://foo.com/pixel?referrer=DOCUMENT_REFERRER"></amp-pixel>
```

**TITLE**

Use the special string `TITLE` to add the title of the current document to the URL

For instance:
```html
<amp-pixel src="https://foo.com/pixel?title=TITLE"></amp-pixel>
```
may make a request to something like `https://foo.com/pixel?title=Breaking%20News`.

**AMPDOC_URL**

Use the special string `AMPDOC_URL` to add the AMP document's URL.

For instance:
```html
<amp-pixel src="https://foo.com/pixel?ref=AMPDOC_URL"></amp-pixel>
```
may make a request to something like `https://foo.com/pixel?ref=https%3A%2F%2Fexample.com%2F`.

**AMPDOC_HOST**

Use the special string `AMPDOC_HOST` to add the AMP document's URL host.

For instance:
```html
<amp-pixel src="https://foo.com/pixel?host=AMPDOC_HOST"></amp-pixel>
```
may make a request to something like `https://foo.com/pixel?host=example.com`.
