### <a name="amp-pixel"></a> `amp-pixel`

The `amp-pixel` element is meant to be used as a typical tracking pixel - to count page views.

#### Behavior

The `amp-pixel` component behaves like a simple tracking pixel `img`. It takes a single URL, but provides variables that can be replaced by the component in the URL string when making the request. See the `src` attribute for more information.

#### Attributes

**src**

A simple URL to send a GET request to when the tracking pixel is loaded.

#### Substitutions

The `amp-pixel` allows all standard URL variable substitutions.
See (Substitutions Guide)[../spec/amp-var-substitutions.md] for more info.

For instance:
```html
<amp-pixel src="https://foo.com/pixel?RANDOM"></amp-pixel>
```
may make a request to something like `https://foo.com/pixel?0.8390278471201` where the RANDOM value is randomly generated upon each impression.

#### Styling

`amp-pixel` should not be styled.
