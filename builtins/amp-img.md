## Behavior

The runtime may choose to delay or prioritize resource loading based on the viewport position, system resources, connection bandwidth, or other factors. The `amp-img` components allows the runtime to effectively manage image resources this way.

`amp-img` components, like all externally fetched AMP resources, must be given an
explicit size (as in width / height) in advance, so that the aspect ratio can be known without fetching the image. Actual layout behavior is determined by the layout attribute.

If the resource requested by the `amp-img` component fails to load, the space will be blank unless a [`fallback`](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/blob/master/spec/amp-html-layout.md#fallback) child is provided. A fallback is only executed on the initial layout and subsequent src changes after the fact (through resize + srcset for example) will not have a fallback for performance implications.

A placeholder background color or other visual can be set using CSS selector and style on the element itself.

The `amp-img` includes attributes for denoting attribution via the attribution attribute.

Additional image features like captions can be implemented with standard HTML - using the `figure` and `figcaption` elements, for example.

## Attributes

**src**

Similar to the `src` attribute on the `img` tag. The value must be a URL that
points to a publicly-cacheable image file. Cache providers may rewrite these
URLs when ingesting AMP files to point to a cached version of the image.

**srcset**

Same as `srcset` attribute on the `img` tag. The behavior will be polyfilled where not natively supported.

**alt**

A string of alternate text, similar to the `alt` attribute on `img`.

**attribution**

A string that indicates the attribution of the image. E.g. `attribution="CC courtesy of Cats on Flicker"`


## Styling

`amp-img` can be styled directly via CSS properties. Setting a grey background
placeholder for example could be achieved via:
```css
amp-img {
  background-color: grey;
}
```
## Validation

See [amp-img rules](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/blob/master/validator/validator-main.protoascii) in the AMP validator specification.
