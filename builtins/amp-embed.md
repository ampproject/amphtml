### <a name="amp-embed"></a> `amp-embed`

The `amp-embed` element is used to allow embedding elements in to the AMP page.

#### Implementation

The `<amp-embed>` is actually an alias to the [`<amp-ad>`](amp-ad.md) tag, deriving all of it's functionality with a different tag name.
Can be used instead of `<amp-ad>` when that would be semantically more accurate.

```html
<amp-embed width=400 height=300
        layout=responsive
        data-publisher=thepublisher
        data-mode=themode
        data-article=auto
        data-placement="Below Article Thumbnails">
</amp-embed>
```
