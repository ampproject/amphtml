# How to work with amp-story-player individually

This document explains how to build and run `amp-story-player` in isolation.

## Build

To build only the `amp-story-player` component, run the following command:

```bash
node amp.js build --extensions=amp-story-player
```

## Development

To run the development server with only the `amp-story-player` component, use the following command:

```bash
node amp.js serve --extensions=amp-story-player
```

The development server will be available at `http://localhost:8000`.
