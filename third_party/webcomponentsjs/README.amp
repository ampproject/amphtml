Description:
Shadow DOM-related polyfills

Local Modifications:
- Stripped to only perform necessary Shadow CSS polyfilling.
- Shortened License based on intended functionality from build pipeline.
- Added feature switches that allows certain codepaths to be
  dead-code-eliminated: `allowArraySelectors` and `isIeSupported`
- All exported functions were originally part of an object named `ShadowCSS`.
  We instead export them as plain functions allow them to be
  dead-code-eliminated, and for their names to be mangled.
  This also involves changing references to each function from `this.x()` to
  just `x()`
- Renamed `scopeSelector()` to `doScopeSelector()` since the original name
  conflicts with argument `scopeSelector` after removing `this.`.
- Removed a `strict` argument before `opt_transformer` in `doScopeSelector`
  to be replaced with the constant value for `strictStyling`.
