Description:
A polyfill for the ResizeObserver API.

The original [polyfill](https://github.com/que-etc/resize-observer-polyfill) has
been [forked](https://github.com/dvoytenko/resize-observer-polyfill) to enable
this polyfill to work across the boundary of Shadow DOM and same-origin
iframes. See https://github.com/que-etc/resize-observer-polyfill/pull/79 for
more details. As soon as this pull request has been merged, the AMP project
will switch to [npm dependency](https://www.npmjs.com/package/resize-observer-polyfill).

Local modifications:
- The installer is wrapped into `installResizeObserver` function. See `ResizeObserver.install.js`.
