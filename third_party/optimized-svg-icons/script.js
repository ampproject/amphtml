I made these because I needed a good set of SVG icons and couldn't find one. Hopefully they come in handy for other people as well.

Found most of the logos on iconmonstr.com and scaled them until they all looked about the same size (like they belong in a 'set' as opposed to just randomly clobbered together from visually dissimilar packs).

I also wrote a little script for Adobe Illustrator to help me scale vectors but had to tweak them by hand anyhow because the negative space makes some icons look bigger than others, etc. You can check it out here if you'd like: https://gist.github.com/ruandre/7b47cbf2a4c55dac9adb#file-fittoartboard-jsx

Note: IE8 and lower gets a text version.
