Description:
Copy of inputmask library and dependency library from release 4.0.4

Local Modifications:
- Patch 0000: Replace the universal module definition with a factory wrapper.
- Patch 0001: Reference Element from the global object dependency-injected into
  the factory. This fixes behavior across iframe boundaries, like in tests.
- Patch 0002: Changed initial unmask behavior when value patching is disabled.
- Patch 0003: In `trigger` implementation, only use CustomEvent for custom
  events, and use native Events for code-initiated user events like "click".

- Patch 0005: Remove extraneous whitespace.
- Patch 0006: Add support for the "?" mask character as a wildcard character.
