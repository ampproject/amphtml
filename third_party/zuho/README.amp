Description:
zuho.js - WebGL equirectangular image viewer

The AMP 360 plugin uses some of the shaders and overall WebGL logic initially implemented in zuho.js.

Files in this directory (copied from https://github.com/y-fujii/zuho):
- zuho.js (from https://github.com/y-fujii/zuho/commit/083a0183c218e388690f48253474d95ab81ef28b)

Local Modifications:
- Removed all event handling, CSS, menu UI and unused projection mappings
- Refactored into module, exporting Renderer and Matrix classes
- Removed String.raw calls (breaks the build)
- Swapped X-axis projection (original code was horizontally mirroring the source image)
