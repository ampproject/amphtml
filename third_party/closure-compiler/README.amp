Description:
Temporary check in of a compiled closure compiler while we wait for
a patch to land.

Local Modifications:
- Add runner.jar which adds custom CommandLineRunner that inerits from
com.google.js.comp.CommandLineRunner which strips `dev.fine` and `dev.assert`.
- Add compiler-and-tests.jar (built from all-classes-jar ant build) to use
for testing.
- Add Messages.properties and ParserConfig.properties for testing.
