Description:
Temporary check in of a compiled closure compiler while we wait for
a patch to land.

Local Modifications:
- Apply ./Allow-relative-path-reference-types.patch to closure-compiler to the
  "closure-compiler-parent-v20190301" tag
  (Needed until https://github.com/google/closure-compiler/issues/3041 is fixed)
- Add custom built compiler.jar (after the above revert) to use for building.
- Apply ./POM-file-changes.patch to closure-compiler and move all files from
  test/ to src/
- Add custom built compiler-and-tests.jar (after the above changes) to use
  for testing.
- Add Messages.properties and ParserConfig.properties for testing.
- Copy web_animations.js extern missing from default externs.
