Description:
Nailgun is a client, protocol, and server for running Java programs from the command line without incurring the JVM startup overhead.

The AMP Project uses a custom version of closure compiler available at build-system/runner/dist/runner.jar. The compiler binary is launched several dozen times during the default multi-pass minification process (gulp dist). In order to speed this up, we use nailgun to launch a reusable instance of closure compiler.
