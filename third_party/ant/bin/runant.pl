# runant.pl
#
# wrapper script for invoking ant in a platform with Perl installed
# this may include cgi-bin invocation, which is considered somewhat daft.
# (slo: that should be a separate file which can be derived from this
# and returns the XML formatted output)
#
# the code is not totally portable due to classpath and directory splitting
# issues. oops. (NB, use File::Spec::Functions  will help and the code is
# structured for the catfile() call, but because of perl version funnies
# the code is not included.
#######################################################################
#
# Assumptions:
#
# - the "java" executable/script is on the command path
# - ANT_HOME has been set
# - target platform uses ":" as classpath separator or perl indicates it is dos/win32
# - target platform uses "/" as directory separator.

#be fussy about variables
use strict;

#platform specifics (disabled)
#use File::Spec::Functions;

#turn warnings on during dev; generates a few spurious uninitialised var access warnings
#use warnings;

#and set $debug to 1 to turn on trace info
my $debug = 1;
