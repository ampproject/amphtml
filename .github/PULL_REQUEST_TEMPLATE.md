# Instructions:

- Pick a meaningful title for your pull request. (Use sentence case.)
  - Prefix the title with an emoji to identify what is being done. (Copy-paste the emoji from the list below.)
  - Do not overuse punctuation in the title (like `(chore):`).
  - If it is helpful, use a simple prefix (like `ProjectX: Implement some feature`).
- Enter a succinct description that says why the PR is necessary, and what it does.
  - Mention the GitHub issue that is being addressed by the pull request.
  - The keywords `Fixes`, `Closes`, or `Resolves` followed the issue number will automatically close the issue.

> NOTE: All non-trivial changes (like introducing new features or components) should have an associated issue or reference an I2I (intent-to-implement: go.amp.dev/i2i). Please read through the contribution process (go.amp.dev/contributing/code) for more information.
