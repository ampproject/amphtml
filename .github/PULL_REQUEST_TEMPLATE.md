# Instructions:

- Pick a meaningful title for your pull request. (Use sentence case.)
  - Prefix the title with an emoji to identify what is being done. (Copy-paste the emoji itself (not the :code:) from the list below.)
  - Do not overuse punctuation in the title (like `(chore):`).
  - If it is helpful, use a simple prefix (like `ProjectX: Implement some feature`).
- Enter a succinct description that says why the PR is necessary, and what it does.
  - Mention the GitHub issue that is being addressed by the pull request.
  - The keywords `Fixes`, `Closes`, or `Resolves` followed the issue number will automatically close the issue.

# Example of a good description:

- Implement aspect X
- Leave out feature Y because of A
- Improve performance by B
- Improve accessibility by C
