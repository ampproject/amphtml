# Instructions:

- Pick a meaningful title for your pull request. (Use sentence case.)
  - Prefix the title with an emoji to identify what is being done. (Copy-paste the emoji from the list below.)
  - Do not overuse punctuation in the title (like `(chore):`).
  - If it is helpful, use a simple prefix (like `ProjectX: Implement some feature`).
- Enter a succinct description that says why the PR is necessary, and what it does.
  - Mention the GitHub issue that is being addressed by the pull request.
  - The keywords `Fixes`, `Closes`, or `Resolves` followed the issue number will automatically close the issue.

> NOTE1: All non-trivial changes (like introducing new features or components) should have an associated issue or reference an I2I (intent-to-implement: go.amp.dev/i2i). Please read through the contribution process (go.amp.dev/docs/code) for more information.
> NOTE2: To ensure that all PR checks are triggered, make sure you've authenticated with the services listed in the one-time setup instructions at https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/blob/main/docs/getting-started-quick.md#one-time-setup (see last step).

# Example of a good description:

- Leave out feature Y because of A
- Improve performance by B
- Improve accessibility by C
