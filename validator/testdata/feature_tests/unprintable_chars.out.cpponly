|    Test Description:
|    The first few bytes in this document are \xef\xbb\xbf\xef\xbb\xbf, which is
|    also known as a byte-order-mark (BOM). These are not renderable bytes and
|    many text viewers will not display them. However, they are also not
|    whitespace.
|
|    An HTML5 compliant parser will open the <body> section immediately upon
|    encountering non-whitespace text outside of the body section. This causes
|    tags which appear to be in the document head to actually be placed in the
|    document body. This creates very confusing errors which are hard to debug for
|    most developers.
