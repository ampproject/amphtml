|    Test Description:
|    Tests errors generated for multiple body tags. This is useful because
|    body tags are treated special - the attributes from all of them are merged
|    into the first one. However, for AMPHTML only a single BODY tag is allowed.
|    In this second variant for the test we show that multiple BODY tags are
|    detected when the body is started by stray text in the head.
|    In which case, the manufactured boy tag message also appears.
|    This is important because otherwise the user might be confused.
