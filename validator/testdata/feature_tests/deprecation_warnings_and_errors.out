|    Test Description:
|    This test contains the old, opacity-based boilerplate and an invalid tag.
|    It is used for testing deprecation warnings and errors.
|    Please don't use the old boilerplate at this point - if you need
|    a starting point use minimum_valid_amp.html, *NOT* this file.
