# HTML Parser

This is an HTML5 compliant parser written in C++. It was created to be used by
the
[AMPHTML Validator](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/tree/master/validator)
to standardize how AMPHTML documents should be parsed for AMP validation.

## Maintainers

This parser is maintained by the [AMP Working Group](https://amp.dev/community/working-groups/amp4email/):
[Caching](https://amp.dev/community/working-groups/caching/)

## Current Status

This parser is in active development and has several outstanding TODOs.
These TODOs may cause certain parsing tests to fail. Those tests have been
excluded until the TODOs are resolved. See htmldataset_test.cc for a list of
those tests.

## Building and Testing with Bazel

This code requires C++17. When building with [Bazel](https://bazel.build/)
please use the flag `--cxxopt='-std=c++17'`.

For building, run: `bazel build --cxxopt='-std=c++17' parser`.
For testing, run: `bazel test --cxxopt='-std=c++17' parser_test`.
