# AMP HTML âš¡ Validator

A validator for the
[AMP HTML format](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/blob/master/README.md).

## Using the command-line tool

* Install Node.js version 4.X on your system. E.g.,
  [by downloading](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) or
  [by using a package manager](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/) or
  [by using NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm).
* Type `node index.js` in this directory to get started:

```
$ node index.js testdata/feature_tests/minimum_valid_amp.html
testdata/feature_tests/minimum_valid_amp.html: PASS

$ node index.js testdata/feature_tests/several_errors.html
testdata/feature_tests/several_errors.html:23:2 The attribute 'charset' may not appear in tag 'meta name= and content='.
testdata/feature_tests/several_errors.html:26:2 The tag 'script' is disallowed except in specific forms.
testdata/feature_tests/several_errors.html:32:2 The mandatory attribute 'height' is missing in tag 'amp-img'. (see https://www.ampproject.org/docs/reference/amp-img.html)
testdata/feature_tests/several_errors.html:34:2 The attribute 'width' in tag 'amp-ad' is set to the invalid value '100%'. (see https://www.ampproject.org/docs/reference/amp-ad.html)
...
```

* If you wish to install the Validator as a system command,
  install the NPM package manager (e.g. using apt-get in Ubuntu Linux) and
  run `npm install -g` in this directory. After that, you may type
  `amp_validator` in any directory to invoke the validator.

## Building a Custom Validator

This is only useful for development - e.g. when making changes to validator.js,
and it's rough aroung the edges. Below are instructions for Linux Ubuntu 14.

Install these packages using apt-get:

* npm
* openjdk-7-jre
* protobuf-compiler
* python-protobuf
* python2.7

In addition, install Node.js version 4.X on your system. E.g.,
  [by downloading](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) or
  [by using a package manager](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/) or
  [by using NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm).

Then, run `build.py`. This creates `dist/validator_minified.js`, which is
equivalent to the validator deployed at cdn.ampproject.org. You may now
use the `--validator_js` command line flag to `index.js` to use this validator.

```
$ node index.js --validator_js dist/validator_minified.js testdata/feature_tests/several_errors.html
testdata/feature_tests/several_errors.html:23:2 The attribute 'charset' may not appear in tag 'meta name= and content='.
testdata/feature_tests/several_errors.html:26:2 The tag 'script' is disallowed except in specific forms.
testdata/feature_tests/several_errors.html:32:2 The mandatory attribute 'height' is missing in tag 'amp-img'. (see https://www.ampproject.org/docs/reference/amp-img.html)
testdata/feature_tests/several_errors.html:34:2 The attribute 'width' in tag 'amp-ad' is set to the invalid value '100%'. (see https://www.ampproject.org/docs/reference/amp-ad.html)
...
```
