# AMP HTML âš¡ Validator

A validator for the
[AMP HTML format](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/blob/master/README.md).

If you just want to validate a page, please see
[our documentation over at amp.dev](https://amp.dev/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/learn/validation-workflow/validate_amp).

## Chrome Extension

Please see [js/chromeextension/README.md](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/blob/master/validator/js/chromeextension/README.md).

## Visual Studio Code Extension

An extension for Visual Studio Code
[VSCode marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=amphtml.amphtml-validator)

## Command Line Tool and Node.js API

Please see [js/nodejs/README.md](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/blob/master/validator/js/nodejs/README.md).

## Web UI

Please see [js/webui/README.md](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/blob/master/validator/js/webui/README.md).

## JSON

The validator rules are exported in the JSON format and hosted on: `https://cdn.ampproject.org/v0/validator.json`

The JSON rules are provided on best-effort basis and it's not recommended to
rely on them in a production environment.

## Building a Custom Validator

This is only useful for development - e.g. when making changes to
`js/engine/validator.js` or when authoring an AMP extension, and it's rough
around the edges. Below are instructions for Linux Ubuntu 14.

## Installation

### Linux

Install these packages using apt-get:

-   `npm`
-   `openjdk-7-jre`
-   `protobuf-compiler`
-   `python3`
-   `python3-pip`

Then `pip3 install protobuf`.

In addition, install Node.js v4.4.2. E.g.,
[by downloading](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) or
[by using a package manager](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/) or
[by using NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm).

### OSX

Dependencies:

-   npm
-   [homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
-   python 3 (e.g. [these instructions](https://docs.python-guide.org/starting/install3/osx/))

    -   protobuf

        ```sh
        pip3 install --user protobuf
        ```

    -   openjdk-7-jre

        Install openjdk, then symlink the system Java wrappers to find it:

        ```sh
        brew install openjdk
        sudo ln -sfn /usr/local/opt/openjdk/libexec/openjdk.jdk /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/openjdk.jdk
        ```

### Usage

Then, run `python build.py`. This creates `dist/validator_minified.js`, which is
equivalent to the validator deployed at cdn.ampproject.org. You may now
use the `--validator_js` command line flag to
[amphtml-validator](https://amp.dev/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/learn/validation-workflow/validate_amp#command-line-tool) to use this validator.

For use for testing with extensions, you can simply run `python build.py`
to run all of the validator tests in the amphtml repo.
To create/update `validator-*.out` files that are used in the test,
run `python build.py --update_tests`.

```sh
$ amphtml-validator --validator_js dist/validator_minified.js testdata/feature_tests/several_errors.html
testdata/feature_tests/several_errors.html:23:2 The attribute 'charset' may not appear in tag 'meta name= and content='.
testdata/feature_tests/several_errors.html:26:2 The tag 'script' is disallowed except in specific forms.
testdata/feature_tests/several_errors.html:32:2 The mandatory attribute 'height' is missing in tag 'amp-img'. (see https://amp.dev/documentation/components/amp-img)
testdata/feature_tests/several_errors.html:34:2 The attribute 'width' in tag 'amp-ad' is set to the invalid value '100%'. (see https://amp.dev/documentation/components/amp-ad)
...
```

### Building on MacOS

_Note: This is for building the validator from source. If you are simply running validator tests for extensions, see the Installation steps instead._

-   Download protobuf with `brew install protobuf` via [homebrew](https://brew.sh/).
-   Use pip to `pip install google` and `pip install protobuf`. If you don't have pip, you can get it either via `brew install python` or [get-pip.py](https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py).
-   If your [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) is out of date, run `npm i -g npm` to update it.

To verify that you have the necessary prerequisites, run and verify:

```sh
$ protoc --version
libprotoc 3.5.1
```

and

```sh
$ python
>>> import google.protobuf
>>>
```

Now `cd amphtml/validator` and run `python build.py`.
