# amp-embedly-card

## Usage

The `amp-embedly-card` component provides you with responsive and shareable embeds to drive the reach of your websites,
blog posts, and articles from any URL using [Embedly cards](http://docs.embed.ly/docs/cards).

Cards are the easiest way to leverage Embedly. For any media, cards provide a responsive embed with built-in embed analytics.

_Example: Embedding multiple resources_

If you have a paid plan, use the `amp-embedly-key` component to set your api key.
You just need one `amp-embedly-key` per AMP page.

```html
<amp-embedly-key value="12af2e3543ee432ca35ac30a4b4f656a" layout="nodisplay">
</amp-embedly-key>
```

If you are a paid user, setting the `amp-embedly-key` tag removes Embedly's branding from the cards.

Within your AMP page, you can include one or multiple `amp-embedly-card` components:

```html
<amp-embedly-card
  data-url="https://twitter.com/AMPhtml/status/986750295077040128"
  layout="responsive"
  width="150"
  height="80"
  data-card-theme="dark"
  data-card-controls="0"
>
</amp-embedly-card>

<amp-embedly-card
  data-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBTCB7yLs8Y"
  layout="responsive"
  width="100"
  height="50"
>
</amp-embedly-card>
```

### Standalone use outside valid AMP documents

Bento allows you to use AMP components in non-AMP pages without needing
to commit to fully valid AMP. You can take these components and place them
in implementations with frameworks and CMSs that don't support AMP. Read
more in our guide [Use AMP components in non-AMP pages](https://amp.dev/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/start/bento_guide/).

To find the standalone version of `amp-embedly-card`, see [**`bento-embedly-card`**](./1.0/README.md).

## Attributes

### `data-url`

The URL to retrieve embedding information.

### `data-card-embed`

The URL to a video or rich media. Use with static embeds like articles, instead
of using the static page content in the card, the card will embed the video or
rich media.

### `data-card-image`

The URL to an image. Specifies which image to use in article cards when
`data-url` points to an article. Not all image URLs are supported, if the image
is not loaded, try a different image or domain.

### `data-card-controls`

Enables share icons.

-   `0`: Disable share icons.
-   `1`: Enable share icons

The default is `1`.

### `data-card-align`

Aligns the card. The possible values are `left`, `center` and `right`. The
default value is `center`.

### `data-card-recommend`

When recommendations are supported, it disables embedly recommendations on video
and rich cards. These are recommendations created by embedly.

-   `0`: Disables embedly recommendations.
-   `1`: Enables embedly recommendations.

The default value is `1`.

### `data-card-via` (optional)

Specifies the via content in the card. This is a great way to do attribution.

### `data-card-theme` (optional)

Allows settings the `dark` theme which changes the background color of the main
card container. Use `dark` to set this theme. For dark backgrounds it's better
to specify this. The default is `light`, which sets no background color of the
main card container.

### title (optional)

Define a `title` attribute for the component to propagate to the underlying `<iframe>` element. The default value is `"Embedly card"`.

### Common attributes

This element includes [common attributes](https://amp.dev/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/learn/common_attributes)
extended to AMP components.
