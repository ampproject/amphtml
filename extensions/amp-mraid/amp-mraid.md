## Overview

When the `amp-mraid` extension is included in an AMPHTML ad it will load
`mraid.js` and register MRAID functions as host services.  This allows
`amp-analytics`, `amp-ad-exit`, and `amp-lightbox` to operate in mobile app ads.

## Validation
The `amp-mraid` extension is intended for [AMPHTML
ads](https://www.ampproject.org/docs/ads/amphtml_ads).  It is intended to be
injected by the ad network after validation, and as such a creative with
`amp-mraid` will not validate.
