# amp-delight-player

The `amp-delight-player` element displays a cloud-hosted [Delight Player](https://delight-vr.com/).

## Example

The `width` and `height` attributes determine the aspect ratio of the player embedded in responsive layouts.
The `data-content-id` attribute is required to load the correct video.

Example:

```html
<amp-delight-player
  data-content-id="-123456789AbCdEfGhIj"
  layout="responsive"
  width="16"
  height="9"
>
</amp-delight-player>
```

Non-responsive layout is also supported.

Example:

```html
<amp-delight-player
  data-content-id="-123456789AbCdEfGhIj"
  width="460"
  height="200"
>
</amp-delight-player>
```

## Attributes

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="40%"><strong>data-content-id (Required)</strong></td>
    <td>The video's content ID.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="40%"><strong>autoplay</strong></td>
    <td>If this attribute is present, and the browser supports autoplay, the video will be automatically
played as soon as it becomes visible. There are some conditions that the component needs to meet
to be played, <a href="https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/blob/master/spec/amp-video-interface.md#autoplay">which are outlined in the Video in AMP spec</a>.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="40%"><strong>dock</strong></td>
    <td><strong>Requires <code>amp-video-docking</code> extension.</strong> If this attribute is present and the video is playing manually, the video will be "minimized" and fixed to a corner or an element when the user scrolls out of the video component's visual area.
    For more details, see <a href="https://amp.dev/documentation/components/amp-video-docking">documentation on the docking extension itself.</a></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="40%"><strong>common attributes</strong></td>
    <td>This element includes <a href="https://amp.dev/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/learn/common_attributes">common attributes</a> extended to AMP components.</td>
  </tr>
