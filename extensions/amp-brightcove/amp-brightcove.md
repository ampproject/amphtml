## Example

The `width` and `height` attributes determine the aspect ratio of the player embedded in responsive layouts.

Example:

```html
<amp-brightcove
  data-account="12345"
  data-player="default"
  data-embed="default"
  data-video-id="1234"
  layout="responsive"
  width="480"
  height="270"
>
</amp-brightcove>
```

## Player configuration

To support AMP's video interface, which is recommended, make sure you configure players used with the AMP Support plugin. See [Brightcove's support documentation](https://support.brightcove.com/amp) for player configuration instructions.

## Validation

See [amp-brightcove rules](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/blob/master/extensions/amp-brightcove/validator-amp-brightcove.protoascii) in the AMP validator specification.
