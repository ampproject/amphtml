## Usage

The `amp-list` defines data source using the following attributes:

- `src` defines a CORS URL. The URL's protocol must be HTTPS.
- `credentials` defines a `credentials` option as specified by the
[Fetch API](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/). To send credentials, pass the
value of "include". If this is set, the response must follow the [AMP CORS security guidelines](../../spec/amp-cors-requests.md).

The response is expected to contain the array that will be rendered. The path to the array
is specified using the optional `items` attribute. This attribute contains the dot-notated path
to the array within the response object. The default value is "items". To indicate that the
response itself is an array, the "." value can be used. The array can be nested within the
response and accessed using, e.g. `items="field1.field2"` expression.

Thus, when `items="items"` is specified (the default) the response must be a JSON object that
contains an array property "items":
```text
{
  "items": [...]
}
```

The template can be specified using either of the following two ways:

- `template` attribute that references an ID of an existing `template` element.
- `template` element nested directly inside of this `amp-list` element.

For more details on templates, see [AMP HTML Templates](../../spec/amp-html-templates.md).

Optionally, `amp-list` element can contain an element with `overflow` attribute. This
element will be shown if AMP Runtime cannot resize the `amp-list` element as requested.

Example: Using overflow
```html
<amp-list src="https://data.com/articles.json?ref=CANONICAL_URL"
    width=300 height=200 layout=responsive>
  <template type="amp-mustache">
    <div>
      <amp-img src="{{imageUrl}}" width=50 height=50></amp-img>
      {{title}}
    </div>
  </template>
  <div overflow role=button aria-label="Show more" class="list-overflow">
    Show more
  </div>
</amp-list>
```

```css
.list-overflow {
  position: absolute;
  bottom: 0;
}
```

## Substitutions

The `amp-list` allows all standard URL variable substitutions.
See [Substitutions Guide](../../spec/amp-var-substitutions.md) for more info.

For example:
```html
<amp-list src="https://foo.com/list.json?RANDOM"></amp-list>
```
may make a request to something like `https://foo.com/list.json?0.8390278471201` where the RANDOM value is randomly generated upon each impression.

## Behavior

The request is always made from the client, even if the document was served from the AMP
cache. Loading is triggered using normal AMP rules depending on how far the element is from
the current viewport.

If `amp-list` needs more space after loading it requests the AMP runtime to update its
height using the normal AMP flow. If AMP Runtime cannot satisfy the request for new
height, it will display `overflow` element when available. Notice however, the typical
placement of `amp-list` elements at the bottom of the document almost always guarantees
that AMP Runtime can resize it.

By default, `amp-list` adds `list` ARIA role to the list element and `listitem` role to item
elements rendered via the template.

## Attributes

**src** (required)

The URL location of the remote endpoint that will return the JSON that will be rendered
within this `amp-list`. This must be a CORS HTTP service.

**credentials** (optional)

Defines a `credentials` option as specified by the [Fetch API](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/).
To send credentials, pass the value of "include". If this is set, the response must follow
the [AMP CORS security guidelines](../../spec/amp-cors-requests.md).

The support values are "omit" and "include". Default is "omit".

**items**

Defines the expression to locate the array to be rendered within the response. It's a dot-notated
expression that navigates via fields of the JSON response. Notice:

- The default value is "items". The expected response: `{items: [...]}`.
- If the response itself is the desired array, use the value of ".". The expected response is: `[...]`.
- Nest navigation is permitted (e.g., "field1.field2"). The expected response is: `{field1: {field2: [...]}}`.

**common attributes**

This element includes [common attributes](https://www.ampproject.org/docs/reference/common_attributes) extended to AMP components.

## Validation

See [amp-list rules](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/blob/master/extensions/amp-list/0.1/validator-amp-list.protoascii) in the AMP validator specification.
