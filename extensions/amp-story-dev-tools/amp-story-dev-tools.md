# amp-story-dev-tools

This extension will provide creators with a range of tools to improve their layouts.

Potential tools:

- Safe areas: The tool will show what the safe areas are for the story, so that important content is never cropped
- Multiple device checks: Users will be able to test the stories on multiple screen sizes
- Story insights: Parse the story and find out layout inconsistencies
