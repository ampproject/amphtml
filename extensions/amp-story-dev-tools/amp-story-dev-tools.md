This extension will provide creators with a range of tools to preview their layouts.

Potential tools:

-   Multiple device checks: Users will be able to test the stories on multiple screen sizes
-   Story insights: Parse the story and find out layout inconsistencies
-   Validation: Ensure story is valid AMP
