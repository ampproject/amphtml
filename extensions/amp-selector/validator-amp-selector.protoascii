# Reference Points apply only to direct children, and all direct children must
# match exactly one reference point. These two criteria don't fit naturally
# with <amp-selector> rules which apply to all descendant tags and don't
# require that all tags match the rule.
# Our appraoch here is two define two reference points. One is a child which
# has no additional requirements, so it always can match. The other is a child
# which has the amp-selector option attributes. The first of these can
# recursively contain either reference point beneath it.
# One small drawback here is that order matters. The list of reference points
# must first match against 'option' before 'child'. Since 'child' will
# always match, we want to prefer 'option' when both of them match.
