     * This field has a lot of internal structure and its type's a little hairy,
     * so here's a rundown of what each piece means:
     *  - If Web Cryptography isn't available in the current browsing context,
     *    then the entire field is null. Since the keys are of no use, we don't
     *    fetch them.
     *  - Otherwise, it's a map-like `Object` from signing service names (as
     *    defined in the Fast Fetch config registry) to "signer" objects.
     *  - The `promise` property of each signer resolves to a boolean indicating
     *    whether the most recent attempt to fetch and import that signing
     *    service's public keys was successful. If the promise is still pending,
     *    then an attempt is currently in progress. This property is mutable;
     *    its value is replaced with a new promise when a new attempt is made.
     *    Invariant: only one attempt may be in progress at a time, so this
     *    property may not be mutated while the current promise is pending.
     *  - The `keys` property of each signer is a map-like `Object` from keypair
     *    IDs to nullable key promises. (This means that a property access on
     *    this object may evaluate to `undefined`, `null`, or a `Promise`
     *    object.) The `keys` object is internally mutable; new keys are added
     *    to it as they are fetched. Invariant: the `keys` object may be mutated
     *    only while the corresponding `promise` object is pending; this ensures
     *    that callbacks chained to `promise` may observe `keys` without being
     *    subject to race conditions.
     *  - If a key promise (i.e., the value of a property access on the `keys`
     *    object) is absent (i.e., `undefined`), then no key with that keypair
     *    ID is present (but this could be because of a stale cache). If it's
     *    null, then no key with that keypair ID could be found even after
     *    cachebusting. If it's a `Promise` that resolves to `null`, then key
     *    data for that keypair ID was found but could not be imported
     *    successfully; this most likely indicates signing service misbehavior.
     *    The success case is a `Promise` that resolves to a `CryptoKey`.
