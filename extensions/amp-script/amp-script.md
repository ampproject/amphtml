## Overview

The `amp-script` component allows you run custom JavaScript to render UI elements, such as a React component.

### A simple example

An `amp-script` element can load JavaScript in two ways:

- Remotely, from a URL to a JavaScript file.
- Locally, from a `script[type=text/plain][target=amp-script]` element on the page.

#### Load JavaScript from a remote URL

Use the `src` attribute to load remote JavaScript.

```html
<amp-script layout="container" src="https://example.com/hello-world.js">
  <button>Hello amp-script!</button>
</amp-script>
```

If `src` points to a cross-origin URL, then a ["script hash"](#security-features) must also be added to the document head.

#### Load JavaScript from a local element

Use the `script` attribute to reference a local `script` element by `id`.

```html
<!-- Using the "script" attribute also requires adding a "script hash" to the document head. -->
<head>
  <meta
    name="amp-script-src"
    content="sha384-YCFs8k-ouELcBTgzKzNAujZFxygwiqimSqKK7JqeKaGNflwDxaC3g2toj7s_kxWG"
  />
</head>

...

<amp-script width="200" height="50" script="hello-world">
  <button>Hello amp-script!</button>
</amp-script>

<!-- Also add [target="amp-script"] to the <script> element. -->
<script id="hello-world" type="text/plain" target="amp-script">
  const btn = document.querySelector('button');
  btn.addEventListener('click', () => {
    document.body.textContent = 'Hello World!';
  });
</script>
```

[tip type="default"]
`amp-script` elements that have a `script` or cross-origin `src` attribute require a ["script hash"](#security-features). Script hashes are specified in a `<meta name="amp-script-src" content="...">` element in the document head.

A console error will be thrown with the expected `content` value -- you can copy/paste from the error to create the appropriate `<meta>` tag.
[/tip]

### How does it work?

`amp-script` runs your custom JavaScript in a [Web Worker](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Using_web_workers) that contains a virtual DOM. When your JavaScript code modifies this virtual DOM, `amp-script` forwards these changes to the main thread and applies them to the `amp-script` element subtree.

For example, adding an element to `document.body`:

```js
// my-script.js
const p = document.createElement('p');
p.textContent = 'I am added to the body!';
document.body.appendChild(p);
```

Will be reflected on the page as a new child of the `amp-script` element:

```html
<amp-script src="http://example.com/my-script.js" width="300" height="100">
  <p>I am added to the body!</p>
</amp-script>
```

Under the hood, `amp-script` uses [@ampproject/worker-dom](https://github.com/ampproject/worker-dom/). For design details, see the ["Intent to Implement" issue](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/issues/13471).

### State manipulation

`amp-script` supports getting and setting [`amp-state`](https://amp.dev/documentation/components/amp-bind/#initializing-state-with-amp-state) JSON via JavaScript.

This enables advanced interactions between `amp-script` and other AMP elements on the page via `amp-bind` [bindings](https://amp.dev/documentation/components/amp-bind/#bindings). Invoking `AMP.setState()` from `amp-script` may cause mutations to the DOM as long as it was triggered by user gesture, otherwise it will only implicitly set state (similar to [`amp-state` initialization](https://amp.dev/documentation/examples/components/amp-bind/?referrer=ampbyexample.com#initializing-state)).

[tip type="default"]
`AMP.setState()` requires the [`amp-bind`](https://amp.dev/documentation/components/amp-bind) extension script to be included in the document head.
[/tip]

```js
/**
 * Deep-merges `json` into the current amp-state.
 * @param {!Object} json A JSON object e.g. must not contain circular references.
 */
AMP.setState(json) {}

/**
 * Asynchronously returns amp-state.
 * @param {string=} expr An optional JSON expression string e.g. "foo.bar".
 * @return {!Promise<!Object>}
 */
AMP.getState(expr) {}
```

##### Example with WebSocket and AMP.setState()

```html
<amp-script width="1" height="1" script="webSocketDemo"> </amp-script>

<!--
  <amp-state> doesn't support WebSocket URLs in its "src" attribute,
  but we can use <amp-script> to work around it. :)
-->
<script type="text/plain" target="amp-script" id="webSocketDemo">
  const socket = new WebSocket('wss://websocket.example');
  socket.onmessage = event => {
    AMP.setState({socketData: event.data});
  };
</script>
```

### Restrictions

#### Allowed APIs

Currently, most DOM elements and their properties are supported. DOM query APIs like `querySelector` have partial support. Browser APIs like `History` are not implemented yet. See the [API compatibility table](https://github.com/ampproject/worker-dom/blob/master/web_compat_table.md) for details.

If there's an API you'd like to see supported, please [file an issue](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/issues/new) and mention `@choumx` and `@kristoferbaxter`.

#### Size of JavaScript code

`amp-script` has the following restrictions on JavaScript file size:

- Maximum of 10,000 bytes per `amp-script` element that uses a local script via `script[type=text/plain][target=amp-script]`.
- Maximum total of 150,000 bytes for all `amp-script` elements on the page.

#### User gestures

`amp-script` generally requires a user gesture to apply changes triggered by your JavaScript code to the page (we call these "mutations"). This requirement helps avoid poor user experience from unexpected content jumping.

The rules for mutations are as follows:

1. Mutations are always accepted for five seconds after a user gesture.
2. The five second interval is extended if the author script performs a `fetch()` as a result of the user gesture.
3. Mutations are always accepted for `amp-script` elements with [`[layout!="container"]`](https://amp.dev/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/develop/style_and_layout/control_layout#supported-values-for-the-layout-attribute) and `height â‰¤ 300px`.

#### Creating AMP elements

With regard to dynamic creation of AMP elements (e.g. via `document.createElement()`), only `amp-img` and `amp-layout` are currently allowed. Please upvote or comment on [#25344](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/issues/25344) with your use case.

#### Security features

Since custom JS run in `amp-script` is not subject to normal [Content Security Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP), we've included some additional measures that are checked at runtime:

1. Same-origin `src` must have [`Content-Type: application/javascript`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Type).
2. Cross-origin `src` and `script` must have matching script hashes in a `meta[name=amp-script-src]` element in the document head. A console error will be emitted with the expected hash string.

Example of script hashes:

```html
<head>
  <!--
    A meta[name="amp-script-src"] element contains all script hashes for
    <amp-script> elements on the page, delimited by spaces.
  -->
  <meta
    name="amp-script-src"
    content="
      sha384-fake_hash_of_remote_js
      sha384-fake_hash_of_local_script
    ">
</head>
<body>
  <!--
    A "src" attribute with a cross-origin URL requires adding a script hash.

    If the hash of remote.js's contents is "fake_hash_of_remote_js",
    we'll add "sha384-fake_hash_of_remote_js" to the <meta> tag above.
  -->
  <amp-script src="cross.origin/remote.js" layout=container>
  </amp-script>

  <!--
    A "script" attribute also requires adding a script hash.

    If the hash of #myScript's text contents is "fake_hash_of_local_script",
    we'll add "sha384-fake_hash_of_local_script" to the <meta> tag above.
  -->
  <amp-script script=myScript layout=container>
  </amp-script>
  <script type=text/plain target=amp-script id=myScript>
    document.body.textContent += 'Hello world!';
  </script>
</body>
```

[tip type="default"]
The JavaScript size and script hash requirements can be disabled during development by adding a `data-ampdevmode` attribute to both the top-level `html` element and the `amp-script` element (or any of its parent nodes).
[/tip]

## Attributes

**src**

For executing remote scripts.

The URL of a JS file that will be executed in the context of this `<amp-script>`. The URL's protocol must be HTTPS and the HTTP response's `Content-Type` must be `application/javascript`.

**script**

For executing local scripts.

The `id` of a `script[type=text/plain][target=amp-script]` element whose text content contains JS that will be executed in the context of this `<amp-script>`.

**sandbox (optional)**

Applies extra restrictions to DOM that may be mutated by this `<amp-script>`. Similar to the `iframe[sandbox]` attribute, the value of the attribute can either be empty to apply all restrictions, or space-separated tokens to lift particular restrictions:

- `allow-forms`: Allows [form elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLFormElement/elements) to be created and modified. AMP requires special handling to prevent unauthorized state changing requests from user input. See amp-form's [security considerations](https://amp.dev/documentation/components/amp-form#security-considerations) for more detail.

**max-age (optional)**

Requires the `script` attribute.

The `max-age` attribute specifies the maximum lifetime in seconds the local script is allowed to be served from the time of [signed exchange (SXG)](https://amp.dev/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/optimize-and-measure/signed-exchange/) publishing.

The value of `max-age` should be chosen carefully:

- A longer `max-age` increases the potential security impact of a [SXG downgrade](https://wicg.github.io/webpackage/draft-yasskin-http-origin-signed-responses.html#seccons-downgrades).

- A shorter `max-age` may prevent inclusion in AMP Caches that have a [minimum SXG lifetime](https://github.com/ampproject/amppackager/blob/releases/docs/cache_requirements.md#google-amp-cache).

If you don't publish signed exchanges, `max-age` does nothing.

**common attributes**

This element includes [common attributes](https://amp.dev/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/learn/common_attributes) extended to AMP components.

## Errors

There are several types of runtime errors that may be encountered when using `amp-script`.

#### "Maximum total script size exceeded (...)"

`amp-script` limits the size of the JS source that may be used. See [Size of JavaScript code](#size-of-javascript-code) above.

#### "Script hash not found."

Local scripts and cross-origin `src` require adding a special `<meta>` tag to be used. See [Security features](#security-features) above.

#### "amp-script... was terminated due to illegal mutation"

To avoid unexpected content jumping, `amp-script` generally requires user gestures for DOM changes. See [User gestures](#user-gestures) above.
