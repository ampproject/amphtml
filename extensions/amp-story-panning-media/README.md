## Summary

Use `amp-story-panning-media` to transition an image between pages.  
This enables building stories around a single image and creating page transition effects like parallax.

A more complete version of this document can be found in [amp.dev](https://amp.dev/documentation/components/amp-story-panning-media/?format=stories).

## Demos
