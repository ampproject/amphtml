## Implementation

The `<amp-embed>` is actually an alias to the [`<amp-ad>`](amp-ad.md) tag, deriving all of its functionality with a different tag name.

```html
<amp-embed width=400 height=300
        layout=responsive
        data-publisher=thepublisher
        data-mode=themode
        data-article=auto
        data-placement="Below Article Thumbnails">
</amp-embed>
```

## Supported embed types

- [Taboola](../ads/taboola.md)

## Validation

See [amp-embed rules](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/blob/master/validator/validator-main.protoascii) in the AMP validator specification.

## Notes

To use `<amp-embed>`, the script to the `amp-ad` library is needed. It is recommended to add the script manually but currently it will be automatically fetched when `amp-embed` is used.
