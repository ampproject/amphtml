# AMP-AD is full of special cases for validation rules that are partly
# implemented in code, so be very careful when editing this file.
# Historically, amp-ad/amp-embed javascript were embedded into the main
# runtime (v0.js), so there are many pages that do not include the amp-ad
# extension. We want to warn for these.
# AMP-EMBED requires the amp-ad extension, not amp-embed.
# Including the amp-ad extension, but not an AMP-AD/AMP-EMBED tag should only
# produce a warning.
#
# To implement this, we mark the tags as requires_extension amp-ad, but the
# main validator also considers the amp-ad extension to always be present
# We then use also_requires_tag_warning to give a warning if the extension
# is missing.
