## Syntax

Mustache is a logic-less template syntax. See [Mustache.js docs](https://github.com/janl/mustache.js/) for more details. Some of the core Mustache tags are:

- `{{variable}}`: A variable tag. It outputs the the HTML-escaped value of a variable.
- `{{#section}}``{{/section}}`: A section tag. It can test the existence of a variable and iterate over it if it's an array.
- `{{^section}}``{{/section}}`: An inverted tag. It can test the non-existence of a variable.

## Usage

The `amp-mustache` template has to be defined and used according to the
[AMP Template Spec](../../spec/amp-html-templates.md).

First, the `amp-mustache` has to be declared/loaded like this:

```html
<script async custom-template="amp-mustache" src="https://cdn.ampproject.org/v0/amp-mustache-0.1.js"></script>
```

Then, the Mustache templates can be defined in the `template` tags like this:

```html
<template type="amp-mustache">
  Hello {{world}}!
</template>
```

How templates are discovered, when they are rendered, how data is provided - all decided by the
target AMP element that uses this template to render its content.

## Restrictions

Like all AMP templates, `amp-mustache` templates are required to be well-formed DOM fragments. This means
that among other things, you can't use `amp-mustache` to:

- Calculate tag name. E.g. `<{{tagName}}>` is not allowed.
- Calculate attribute name. E.g. `<div {{attrName}}=something>` is not allowed.
- Output arbitrary HTML using `{{{unescaped}}}`. The output of "triple-mustache" is sanitized to only allow
formatting tags such as `<b>`, `<i>`, and so on.

Notice also that because the body of the template has to be specified within the `template` element, it is
impossible to specify `{{&var}}` expressions - they will always be escaped as `{{&amp;var}}`. The triple-mustache
`{{{var}}}` has to be used for these cases.

## Validation

See [amp-mustache rules](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/blob/master/extensions/amp-mustache/0.1/validator-amp-mustache.protoascii) in the AMP validator specification.
