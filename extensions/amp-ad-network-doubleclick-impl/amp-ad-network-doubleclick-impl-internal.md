    <td width="40%"><strong>Description</strong></td>
    <td>DoubleClick implementation of AMP Ad tag which requests early by XHR and
    renders natively within the page if a valid AMP Ad is returned.  Should
    not be directly referenced by pages and instead is dynamically loaded
    via the amp-ad tag.  However, in order to remove an async script load
    of this library, publishers can include its script declaration.</td>

#### Examples
Example - DoubleClick Ad
```html
<amp-ad width=728 height=90
    type="doubleclick"
    data-slot="/6355419/Travel">
</amp-ad>
```

Example - DoubleClick Ad with Multi-size Request
```html
<amp-ad width=728 height=90
    type="doubleclick"
    data-slot="/6355419/Travel"
    data-multi-size="700x90,700x60,500x60">
</amp-ad>
```

Example - DoubleClick Ad with Multi-size Request Ignoring Size Validation
```html
<amp-ad width=728 height=90
    type="doubleclick"
    data-slot="/6355419/Travel"
    data-multi-size="300x25"
    data-multi-size-validation="false">
</amp-ad>
```

#### Attributes
Below the term `primary size` refers to the width and height pair specified by the `width` and `height` attributes of the tag.
- `data-multi-size` A string of comma separated sizes, which if present, forces the tag to request an ad with all of the given sizes, including the primary size. Each individual size must be a number (the width) followed by a lowercase 'x' followed by a number (the height). Each dimension specified this way must not be larger than its counterpart in the primary size. Further, each dimension must be no less than 2/3rds of the corresponding primary dimension, unless `data-mutli-size-validation` is set to false.
- `data-multi-size-validation` If set to false, this will allow secondary sizes (those specified in the `data-multi-size` attribute) to be less than 2/3rds of the corresponding primary size. By default this is assumed to be true.
