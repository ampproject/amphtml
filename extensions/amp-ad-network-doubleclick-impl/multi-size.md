# Multi-size Ad

To request an ad with multiple sizes, pass a string of comma-separated sizes to
the `data-multi-size` attribute. Each size in the list must be a width followed
by a lowercase 'x' followed by a height. Secondary sizes must not be larger than
their corresponding dimensions specified by the `width` and `height` attributes,
or the `data-override-width` and `data-override-height` attributes, if they are
set. Further, the secondary sizes must not be smaller than 2/3rds, in any of the
two dimensions, of their primary size counterpart, unless
`data-multi-size-validation` is explicitly set to false. See below for some valid and invalid examples.

<b>Note that multi-size slots may have unexpected interactions with
`layout="responsive"`. For this reason it is strongly encouraged that multi-size
slots use `layout="fixed"`.</b>

#### Attributes

Below the term `primary size` refers to the width and height pair specified by the `width` and `height` attributes of the tag.

- `data-multi-size` A string of comma separated sizes, which if present, forces the tag to request an ad with all of the given sizes, including the primary size. Each individual size must be a number (the width) followed by a lowercase 'x' followed by a number (the height). Each dimension specified this way must not be larger than its counterpart in the primary size. Further, each dimension must be no less than 2/3rds of the corresponding primary dimension, unless `data-multi-size-validation` is set to false.
- `data-multi-size-validation` If set to false, this will allow secondary sizes (those specified in the `data-multi-size` attribute) to be less than 2/3rds of the corresponding primary size. By default this is assumed to be true.

Example - Valid multi-size request

```html
<amp-ad
  width="728"
  height="90"
  type="doubleclick"
  layout="fixed"
  data-slot="/6355419/Travel"
  data-multi-size="700x90,700x60,500x60"
>
</amp-ad>
```

Example - Invalid multi-size request (multi-size size is too small relative to overrides)

```html
<amp-ad
  width="320"
  height="50"
  type="doubleclick"
  layout="fixed"
  data-slot="/6355419/Travel"
  data-override-width="728"
  data-override-height="90"
  data-multi-size="300x25"
>
</amp-ad>
```

Example - Invalid multi-size request (last multi-size size is too small)

```html
<amp-ad
  width="728"
  height="90"
  type="doubleclick"
  layout="fixed"
  data-slot="/6355419/Travel"
  data-multi-size="700x90,700x60,300x25"
>
</amp-ad>
```

Example - Valid multi-size request (ignores minimum size constraint)

```html
<amp-ad
  width="728"
  height="90"
  type="doubleclick"
  layout="fixed"
  data-slot="/6355419/Travel"
  data-multi-size="700x90,700x60,300x25"
  data-multi-size-validation="false"
>
</amp-ad>
```
