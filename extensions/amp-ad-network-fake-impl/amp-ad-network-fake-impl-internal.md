## Behavior

The 'fake' ad network produces only a single ad request and
attempts to render it via the A4A fast rendering path. It is intended only
for testing and demos. To send an ad request with 'fake' ad network, it is
required that the ad element to have an id value starts with `i-amphtml-demo-`
which makes the AMP page invalid.

Like all A4A ad networks, you do not place an `<amp-ad-network-fake-impl>`
tag directly on the page. Instead, you place an `<amp-ad type="fake">` tag.

The fake implementation will fetch the creative from the given path if using
the `src` attribute. If using the `srcdoc` attribute the fake impl will write
the inlined document string as the test creative. Using either `src` or
`srcdoc` is required.

The fake impl loads an A4A creative or an AMP creative and converts it to an A4A
creative. Use `a4a-conversion` attribute to instruct the fake impl to perform creative
conversion.

The fake impl will skip signature verification by default. To enforce this check,
set `checksig` attribute. This can be useful to test the ad's behavior when signature
verification fails.

## Attributes

Fake impl largely uses the same tags as `<amp-ad>`. The following are
special tags for fake or special behaviors of existing tags:

**id** Must start with `i-amphtml-demo-` to enable sending ad request.

**type** Must be `"fake"`.

**src** The file source.

**srcdoc** Inlined text containing creative's document.

**a4a-conversion** To instruct the fake impl to convert creative response to A4A creative.

**checksig** To enforce the signature check.
