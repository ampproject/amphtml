# amp-minute-media-player

## Example

Example with RESPONSIVE layout - width and height attributes determine the aspect ratio of the player embedded.

```html
<amp-minute-media-player
  data-content-type="curated"
  data-content-id="fSkmeWKF"
  width="500"
  height="334"
  layout="responsive"
  autoplay
>
</amp-minute-media-player>
```

Example with FIXED layout - fixed width and height.

```html
  <amp-minute-media-player
    data-content-type="semantic"
    data-scanned-element-type="tag"
    data-scanned-element="post-body"
    layout="fixed" width="500" height="334"
  </amp-minute-media-player>
