# amp-geo

## Usage

The `amp-geo` component provides country-level geolocation. The `amp-geo`
component also provides a simple mechanism to group countries, making it easier
to apply attributes to several countries at once.

The `amp-geo` component uses the country from which the request originated in
the form of an
[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2 'ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 ')
country code. The `amp-geo` component determines this code from the client's IP
address. The ISO country code may not be the same as the top-level domain. For
example, the code for the United Kingdom is `gb` not `uk`.

It's possible that an IP address with country information in the WHOIS database
will not have country information in `amp-geo`. If the country cannot be
determined, the value is set to `unknown`. If the grouping feature is used at
least one group must contain `unknown`.

The `amp-geo` component provides CSS,
[`amp-bind`](../amp-bind/amp-bind.md) and variable
substitution interfaces.

### Generated CSS classes

If the `amp-iso-country-XX` class is applied to the `body` element, where `XX`
is replaced by the ISO country code or with the value `unknown`, you can use CSS
to modify the `body` element.

In the following example, we add `<amp-geo>` to determine the user's location so
that we can display the appropriate flag.

```html
<amp-geo layout="nodisplay"></amp-geo>
```

If the user is in Canada, the `amp-geo` component applies the
`amp-iso-country-ca` CSS class to the `body` tag. We can then use CSS to apply
the correct background image for Canada:

```css
/* defaults */
.flag {
  background-image: './starsandstripes.png';
}
/* override */
.amp-iso-country-ca .flag {
  background-image: './mapleleaf.png';
}
```

### Optional configuration for grouping locations

Optionally, you can include a JSON configuration script in the `amp-geo` tag.
The `ISOCountryGroups` key allows selections by groups of country codes.

```html
<amp-geo layout="nodisplay">
  <script type="application/json">
    {
      "ISOCountryGroups": {
        "soccer": ["au", "ca", "ie", "nz", "us", "za"],
        "football": ["unknown"]
      }
    }
  </script>
</amp-geo>
```

If country groups are specified, `amp-geo` iterates through the groups. For any
group that contains the current country, a class named `amp-geo-group-` followed
by the group name is added to `<body>`. Group names may only contain a-z, A-Z
and 0-9, and may not start with a digit. If no country group is matched the
class `amp-geo-no-group` is added to `body`.

#### Example: Generated CSS classes

```html
<body class="amp-geo-group-football amp-iso-country-gb â€¦"></body>
```

#### Example: Using CSS classes and country groups to change "soccer" to "football"

In the following example, we determine if the user is in a "soccer" country and
display a "football" message for those users.

```html
<amp-geo layout="nodisplay">
  <script type="application/json">
    {
      "ISOCountryGroups": {
        "soccer": ["au", "ca", "ie", "nz", "us", "za"],
        "football": ["unknown"]
      }
    }
  </script>
</amp-geo>
```

If the user is in one of the "soccer" countries, the `amp-geo-group-soccer` CSS
class is applied to the `body` tag.

```css
/* defaults */
.football:after {
  content: 'football';
}
/* override */
.amp-geo-group-soccer .football:after {
  content: 'soccer';
}
```

Then it's trivial to use CSS select the correct word (i.e., football).

```html
<div>The game is called <span class="football"></span>!</div>
```

### Preset Country Groups

In addition to user specified country groups `amp-geo` supports preset country
lists. See [`amp-geo-presets.js`](0.1/amp-geo-presets.js)
for the available preset lists.

#### U.S. California Detection

The `amp-geo` component provides the
[ISO 3166-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-2) information when it
determines a request is from California. The `preset-us-ca` value from the
preset list supports this feature.

Additional countries may be included with the preset list as in the `myList`
example below.

```html
<amp-geo layout="nodisplay">
  <script type="application/json">
    {
      "ISOCountryGroups": {
        "eea": ["preset-eea"],
        "usca": ["preset-us-ca"],
        "myList": ["preset-eea", "preset-us-ca", "ca", "au", "nz"]
      }
    }
  </script>
</amp-geo>
```

### Render Blocking

By default, the `amp-geo` component is not render blocking. That is, the page
will load and elements will render even if `amp-geo` has not yet loaded and
executed. If it's important that certain elements are never rendered in a
specific geography, use the `amp-geo-pending` class to provide selective render
blocking. This is implemented by the publisher by adding `amp-geo-pending` to
the `<body>` element. When the `amp-geo` script loads, it removes the
`amp-geo-pending` class at the same time as it adds the `amp-iso-country...` and
`amp-geo-group-...` classes.

_Example_: To always suppress an element that has the `foo` class in the United
States, set `<body class="amp-geo-pending">`, and in the CSS include the
following:

```css
.amp-geo-pending .foo,
.amp-iso-country-us .foo {
  display: none;
}
```

This CSS hides the element that has the `foo` class until `amp-geo` has loaded
and continues to hide it if the country is `us`.

[tip type="note"]

Elements such as `amp-ad` and `amp-iframe` do not make external network requests
when set to `display: none`.

### Integration with amp-bind

If the `AmpBind` key is present in the configuration, `amp-geo` inserts an
`amp-state` tag containing the current country and group information. Using the
football example above, set the `AmpBind` flag to true to enable `amp-bind`
integration.

```html
<amp-geo layout="nodisplay">
  <script type="application/json">
    {
      "AmpBind": true,
      "ISOCountryGroups": {
        "soccer": ["au", "ca", "ie", "nz", "us", "za"],
        "football": ["unknown"]
      }
    }
  </script>
</amp-geo>
```

If the user were in Canada, the inserted `amp-state` would be as follows:

```html
<amp-state id="ampGeo">
  <script type="application/json">
    {
      "ISOCountry": "ca",
      "soccer": true
    }
  </script>
</amp-state>
```

[/filter]<!-- formats="websites" -->

### <a name="variable-substitution"></a>Variable substitution

The country code is also available via AMP variable substitution:

`AMP_GEO` or `${ampGeo}` returns the list of matched groups (comma delimited).
`AMP_GEO(ISOCountry)` or `${ampGeo(ISOCountry)}` returns the country code (or
`unknown`).

### Caching

The `amp-geo` JavaScript file is served with a 30-minute cache lifetime
(`Cache-control: private, max-age=1800`) to prevent use of stale geolocation
data and to ensure that the geolocation is accurate when a user moves location.

### Pre-rendering

The `amp-geo` component supports pre-rendering. If the document is served from
the publisher origin and it already contains a class matching
`amp-iso-country-*` `amp-geo` respects that value. `amp-geo` will use the
supplied country and configuration to supply data to cooperating AMP extensions
(e.g., `amp-consent`). If a pre-rendered country code is detected, the document
will not be modified by `amp-geo` to add classes for country group or
`amp-state`.

However, if the document is served via one of the
[AMP caches](../../build-system/global-configs/caches.json),
`amp-geo` removes and replaces any supplied geolocation classes and, if the
`amp-bind` configuration key is true, updates `<amp-state id="ampGeo">`
accordingly. This allows publishers to use their own geolocation code when the
document is served directly from their origin while retaining dynamic
configuration when served from a cache.

Caches that wish to pre-render `amp-geo` should
[open an issue](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/issues/new) requesting to
be removed from the pre-render override.

### Self Hosting

Publishers and caches that re-host AMP JavaScript files must implement
server-side patching of the `amp-geo-0.1.js` file or pre-rendering (see above).

The file served from `cdn.ampproject.org` should not be used as a base for
patching because it will have already been patched when downloaded. Instead the
base `./dist/v0/amp-geo-0.1.js` file should be used.

The string `{{AMP_ISO_COUNTRY_HOTPATCH}}` must be replaced at serving time with
the lowercase 2 letter
[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2 'ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 ')
country code corresponding to the requesting IP address. This value should be
padded to match the original length to avoid breaking the
`amp-geo-0.1.max.js.map` file. If the country cannot be determined "unknown"
country can be indicated by either leaving the file un-patched or patching with
a string of spaces of equal length.

### Debugging

Adding `#amp-geo=XX` to the document url forces the country to appear as the
country `XX`. This allows you to test without having to VPN to a country. For
security reasons, to prevent sharing of geo-spoofing urls, this feature is only
available to users who have enabled the
[Experimental Channel](https://amp.dev/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/learn/experimental)
or who are testing locally (i.e., `amp-geo.js` is served in development mode via
[`amp serve`](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/blob/master/contributing/DEVELOPING.md)).

[tip type="note"]

Debugging in DevChannel may not work in Safari due to
[ITP](https://webkit.org/blog/8311/intelligent-tracking-prevention-2-0/).
