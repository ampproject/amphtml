# AMP HTML Extensions

AMP Extensions are either extended components or extended templates.

## AMP HTML Extended Components

Extended components must be explicitly included into the document as custom elements.

For example, to include a YouTube video in your page
include the following script in the `<head>`:

```html
<script async custom-element="amp-youtube" src="https://cdn.ampproject.org/v0/amp-youtube-0.1.js"></script>
```

## Current list of components

See the [Components](https://www.ampproject.org/docs/reference/components) list.


## AMP HTML Extended Templates

See the [AMP template spec](../spec/amp-html-templates.md) for details about supported templates.
