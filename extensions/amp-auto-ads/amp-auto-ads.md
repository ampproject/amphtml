# amp-auto-ads

## Behavior

Given a sufficient number of valid placements (supplied in the configuration),
`amp-auto-ads` tries to insert additional ads while adhering to a set of
constraints specified by the ad network. These constraints will limit:

<ul>
  <li>The total number of ads that can be inserted</li>
  <li>The minimum distance that there should be between any adjacent ads</li>
</ul>
In addition to this, ads will only be inserted in locations on the page that do
not cause an unacceptable re-flow (as determined by attemptChangeSize).

The `<amp-auto-ads>` tag should be placed as the first child of the `<body>`.

The ad network type and any additional information (required by the ad network)
should be specified on the tag.

```html
<amp-auto-ads type="adsense" data-ad-client="ca-pub-5439573510495356">
</amp-auto-ads>
```

## Supported ad networks

- [AdSense](../../ads/google/adsense.md)
- [Denakop](https://denakop.com)
- [DoubleClick (experimental)](../../ads/google/doubleclick.md)
- [Premium Programmatic](https://premiumads.com.br)

## Attributes

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="40%"><strong>type (required)</strong></td>
    <td>An identifier for the ad network.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="40%"><strong>data-foo-bar</strong></td>
    <td>Most ad networks require further configuration, which can be passed to the network by using HTML <code>data-</code> attributes. The parameter names are subject to standard data attribute dash to camel case conversion. For example, "data-foo-bar" is send to the ad for configuration as "fooBar". See the documentation for the <a href="#supported-ad-networks">ad network</a> on which attributes can be used.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="40%"><strong>common attributes</strong></td>
    <td>This element includes <a href="https://amp.dev/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/learn/common_attributes">common attributes</a> extended to AMP components.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

## Configuration Spec

The configuration defines where on the page `<amp-auto-ads>` can place ads. The configuration is fetched from a third-party ad network at the URL defined in `ad-network-config.js`. The configuration should be a serialized JSON object matching the [`ConfigObj`](#configobj) definition described below.

### Example Configuration

The following example specifies that the ad should be positioned immediately
positions immediately after all `<P class='paragraph'>` elements that are within the third `<DIV id='domId'>` on the page. An ad placed in any of these positions should be of type BANNER and have a top margin of 4px and a bottom margin of 10px.

```json
{
  "placements": [
    {
      "anchor": {
        "selector": "DIV#domId",
        "index": 2,
        "sub": {
          "selector": "P.paragraph",
          "all": true
        }
      },
      "pos": 4,
      "type": 1,
      "style": {
        "top_m": 5,
        "bot_m": 10
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

</table>

    <th class="col-fourty" >Description</th>
  </tr>

    <td>BANNER</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>Placement describes a banner ad position.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

#### AdConstraintsObj

The fields to specify in the `adConstraints` configuration object:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th class="col-twenty">Field Name</th>
    <th class="col-twenty">Type</th>
    <th class="col-fourty" >Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>initialMinSpacing</code></td>
    <td>string</td>
    <td>
      A <strong>required</strong> field that indicates the minimum distance that an ad should be from any ads already on the page (either manually placed or previously placed by amp-auto-ads) at the time of insertion.
      Values are expressed as a number with a units prefix. E.g. "10px" means 10 pixels, or "0.5vp" means half a viewport height. Negative values are invalid. The supported units are:
      <ul>
        <li>px - pixels</li>
        <li>vp - multiple of viewport height</li>
      </ul>
      This value applies only when the number of ads already on the page is less than any <code>adCount</code> matcher specified in the subsequentMinSpacing field.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>subsequentMinSpacing</code></td>
    <td>Array&lt;!SubsequentMinSpacingObj&gt;</td>
    <td>
      An <em>optional</em> field that specifies the ad spacings that should apply based on how many ads are already on the page at the time of insertion.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>maxAdCount</code></td>
    <td>number</td>
    <td>
      A <strong>required</strong> field that specifies the maximum number of ads that <code>amp-auto-ads</code> can cause there to be on a page. Both manually placed ads, as well as those placed by <code>amp-auto-ads</code> count towards this total.
      E.g. if this field were set to 5 and there were 3 manually placed ads on the page, then <code>amp-auto-ads</code> would place a maximum of 2 additional ads.
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

#### SubsequentMinSpacingObj

The fields to specify in the `subsequentMinSpacing` configuration object. `subsequentMinSpacing` entries
can be used to change the spacing required between any additional ads based on the number of ads already on
the page. As an example, consider the following scenario:

<ul>
  <li>2 existing ads on the page</li>
  <li>subsequentMinSpacing field is:
    <code>
      [
        {adCount: 3, spacing: "500px"},
        {adCount: 5, spacing: "1000px"},
      ]
    </code>
  </li>
</ul>
Initially there are 2 existing ads on the page, so no mapping matches.
The minimum spacing therefore defaults to initialMinSpacing in the `AdConstraints` object.
`amp-auto-ads` will recursively try to place ads until it runs out of placements that
could be used without breaking the `adContraints`.
After `amp-auto-ads` has placed its first ad, there are now 3 ads on the page, since
there is a mapping for 3 (or more) ads in `subsequentMinSpacing`, the min spacing now becomes 500px.
This applies up until the point where there are 5 ads on the page, since
there is a rule for 5 ads. Inserting the 6+th ad would then require
it to be clear of other ads by at least 1000px.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th class="col-twenty">Field Name</th>
    <th class="col-twenty">Type</th>
    <th class="col-fourty" >Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>adCount</code></td>
    <td>number</td>
    <td>
      A <strong>required</strong> field.
      The minimum number of ads already on the page that cause this rule to apply (assuming no other rule is a better match). See description above
      for a more detailed explanation.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>spacing</code></td>
    <td>string</td>
    <td>
      A <strong>required</strong> field that specifies the minimum ad spacing that applies when this rule is matched based on the <code>adCount</code>.
      Values are expressed as a number with a units prefix. E.g. "10px" means 10 pixels, or "0.5vp" means half a viewport height. Negative values are invalid. The supported units are:
      <ul>
        <li>px - pixels</li>
        <li>vp - multiple of viewport height</li>
      </ul>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
