## Overview

The `amp-fx-collection` extension provides a collection of preset visual effects,
such as parallax that can be easily enabled on any element via attributes.

Currently, only the `parallax` effect is supported. More effects such as `fade-in`, `slide-in`
are planned to be supported soon.

To specify a visual effect for an element, add the `amp-fx` attribute with the value of the visual effect.


## Visual effects

Below are the supported visual effects for the amp-fx-collection:

### parallax

The `parallax` effect allows an element to move as if it is nearer or farther relative
to the foreground of the page content. As the user scrolls the page, the element
scrolls faster or slower depending on the value assigned to the
`data-parallax-factor` attribute.

##### data-parallax-factor

Specifies a decimal value that controls how much faster or slower the element scrolls
relative to the scrolling speed:

- A value greater than 1 scrolls the element upward (element scrolls faster) when the user scrolls down the page.
- A value less than 1 scrolls the element downward (element scrolls slower) when the user scrolls downward.
- A value of 1 behaves normally.
- A value of 0 effectively makes the element scroll fixed with the page.

#### Example: Title parallax

In this example, as the user scrolls the page, the h1 element scrolls faster relative to the page's content.

```html
<h1 amp-fx="parallax" data-parallax-factor="1.5">
  A title that moves faster than other content.
</h1>
```
