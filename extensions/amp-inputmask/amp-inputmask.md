# amp-inputmask

## Usage

`amp-inputmask` enables the `mask` and `mask-output` attributes on `input`
elements. These allow document authors to specify input masks for their form
elements.

Input masks automatically add formatting characters to user input, and prevent
users from typing input that doesn't match the mask. For example, an input mask
on a telephone field automatically adds special characters like `(`, `)` and
`-`, and users can type only the numbers needed while the mask prevents them
from typing incorrect characters.

### Supported elements

-   `input[type=text]`
-   `input[type=tel]`
-   `input[type=search]`

## Attributes

### `mask` (required)

Specifies the mask or masks to apply to the input element.

Custom masks are composed of the following characters,
and may be listed separated by spaces:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th width="30%"><code>mask</code><br>character</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>L</code></td>
    <td>The user must add an alphabetical character</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>0</code></td>
    <td>The user must add a numeric character</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>A</code></td>
    <td>The user must add an alphanumeric character</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>C</code></td>
    <td>The user must add an arbitrary character</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>l</code></td>
    <td>The user may optionally add an alphabetical character</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>a</code></td>
    <td>The user may optionally add an alphanumeric character</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>c</code></td>
    <td>The user may optionally add an arbitrary character</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>9</code></td>
    <td>The user may optionally add a numeric character.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>\</code></td>
  <td>The backslash <code>\</code> escapes the next character in the mask to be a character
    literal.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>_</code></td>
    <td>The mask will automatically insert a space character</td>
  </tr>
</table>

As an example, this masked input will allow the user to enter a
Canadian postal code. The space will be automatically added for the user.

```html
<input mask="L0L_0L0" placeholder="A1A 1A1" type="text" />
```

This mask allows a user to enter either a 5-digit or a 9-digit US ZIP code.
The hyphen will be automatically added as the user types the sixth digit.

```html
<input mask="00000 00000-0000" placeholder="10001" type="tel" />
```

This mask accepts a North American phone number.
The characters "+", "1", " ", "(", ")" and "-" will be automatically added as the user types.

```html
<input type="tel" mask="+1_(000)_000-0000" placeholder="+1 (555) 555-5555" />
```

The following named masks are supported:

<strong>`payment-card`</strong>
The user must enter a payment card number.
The mask automatically adds spaces to chunk the numbers, and supports both
American Express-style and Visa-style chunking.

As an example, this masked input will allow the user to enter a payment card number.
Space characters " " will be automatically added as the user types.

```html
<input type="tel" mask="payment-card" placeholder="0000 0000 0000 0000" />
```

### `mask-trim-zeros`

Specifies how many zeros the mask will remove from pasted values into custom
masks. For backwards compatibility, the default is `2`. Specify `0` to disable
this behavior.

When users paste values from spreadsheets, often there is a zero padding on the
left side. For example, North American phone numbers are sometimes stored as
015551112222 where 1 is the country code, but it has been zero-padded. The
`mask-trim-zeros` attribute will remove up to the given number of zeros. The
`mask-trim-zeros` attribute does not affect named masks

### `mask-output`

Specifies how the form will submit the input value.

-   **raw** (default): Outputs the value as-is with all special characters.
-   **alphanumeric**: Only outputs alphanumeric characters in the mask. The form
    will add a `type="hidden"` input with the masked input's `name` or `id`
    attribute with `-unmasked` appended.

In the example below the `mask-output` output attribute is set to `raw`.

```html
<input
  mask="+\1_(000)_000-0000"
  mask-output="raw"
  name="phone"
  type="tel"
  placeholder="+1 (555) 555-5555"
/>
```

If the `mask-output` attribute is missing, the default is `raw`

```html
<!-- missing `mask-output`, which is equivalent to `mask-output="raw"` -->
<input
  mask="+\1_(000)_000-0000"
  name="phone"
  type="tel"
  placeholder="+1 (555) 555-5555"
/>
```

When `mask-output` is set to `raw`, the form will submit the `input` value as-is. For example, if the input contains `+1 (800) 123-4567`, the form will submit the following value:

```json
{"phone": "+1 (800) 123-4567"}
```

Here, the `mask-output` output attribute is set to `alphanumeric`.

```html
<input
  mask="+\1_(000)_000-0000"
  mask-output="alphanumeric"
  name="phone"
  type="tel"
  placeholder="+1 (555) 555-5555"
/>
```

When `mask-output` is set to `alphanumeric`, the form will submit the `input` value as-is, and the form will add a hidden input. The hidden input will have the alphanumeric characters from the original input. Its `name` will be the original input's name with `-unmasked` appended. For example, if the input contains `+1 (800) 123-4567`, the form will submit the following values:

```json
{
  "phone": "+1 (800) 123-4567",
  "phone-unmasked": "18001234567"
}
```
