# amp-smartlinks

## Overview

At [Narrativ](https://narrativ.com/), we transform static commerce links into dynamic, multimerchant nodes. With a library of millions of products matched to expert reviews from top commerce publishers, we lift publisher revenue through real-time bidding and data solutions.

This AMP extension is our Linkmate service in AMP. See the full documentation for Linkmate [here](http://docs.narrativ.com/en/stable/linkmate.html).

## Getting started

Your account must be a member of our Linkmate program to use this feature. For more information about this program, feel free to contact your account manager or [hello@narrativ.com](mailto:hello@narrativ.com).

NOTE: If you plan to use `amp-smartlinks` alongside other affiliate partners you will need to specify the meta tag shown below. The tag will specify the order in which the affiliate tags fire.

In your AMP page you will have to add the following snippets:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html âš¡>
  <head>
    ...
    <meta
      name="amp-link-rewriter-priorities"
      content="amp-smartlinks amp-other-affiliate"
    />
    <script
      async
      custom-element="amp-smartlinks"
      src="https://cdn.ampproject.org/v0/amp-smartlinks-0.1.js"
    ></script>
    ...
    <script async src="https://cdn.ampproject.org/v0.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    ...
    <amp-smartlinks
      layout="nodisplay"
      nrtv-account-name="supercoolpublisher"
      linkmate
    >
    </amp-smartlinks>
    ...
  </body>
</html>
```
