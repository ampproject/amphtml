[TOC]

## Behavior

The `amp-fit-text` component expects its content to be text or other inline
content, but it can also contain non-inline content. For the given content
the `amp-fit-text` will try to find the best font size to fit all of the
content within the available space.

If content of the `amp-fit-text` is overflowing the available space event with
the minimum font size, the overflowing content will be cut off and hidden. The
WebKit and Blink-based browsers will show ellipsis in this case.

The `amp-fit-text` accepts one of the following `layout` values: `fixed`,
`fixed-height`, `responsive` or `fill`.

For example:
```html
<amp-fit-text width="300" height="200" layout="responsive"
    max-font-size="52">
  Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, has nisl nihil convenire et, vim at aeque
  inermis reprehendunt.
</amp-fit-text>
```
