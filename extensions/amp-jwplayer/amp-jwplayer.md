## Example

The `width` and `height` attributes determine the aspect ratio of the player embedded in responsive layouts.

Example:

```html
<amp-jwplayer
    data-player-id="aBcD1234"
    data-media-id="5678WxYz"
    layout="responsive"
    width="16" height="9">
</amp-jwplayer>
```

Non-responsive layout is also supported.

Example:

```html
<amp-jwplayer
    data-player-id="aBcD1234"
    data-playlist-id="5678WxYz"
    width="160" height="90">
</amp-jwplayer>
```
