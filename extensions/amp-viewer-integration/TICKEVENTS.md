### Tick Events

When implementing a viewer one can use the tick events for performance tracking.

We use very short string names as tick labels, so the table below
further describes these labels.
Every start label has an assumed e\_`label` for its "end" counterpart label.
As an example if we executed `perf.tick('label')` we assume we have a counterpart
`perf.tick('e_label')`.
