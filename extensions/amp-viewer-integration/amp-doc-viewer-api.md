# AMP Viewer API

## Introduction

This document explains the API between an AMP Viewer and the AMP document(s) it contains.

## API

### Initialization

When an AMP Viewer opens an AMP document, it can include initialization parameters. The parameters are set as key value pairs encoded as a query string in the hash fragment of the AMP document URL. For example:
www.amp.dev?origin=https%3A%2F%2Fplayground.amp.dev
Some parameters are read by the AMP runtime (the core library that initializes and manages all components, included as v0.js) and configure its behavior and others are read by the [Viewer integration script](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/blob/main/extensions/amp-viewer-integration/0.1/amp-viewer-integration.js) in order to establish the communication channel used by the rest of the API. An initialization parameter is enabled or disabled via the '1' or '0' value respectively.

#### Viewer Integration Script Parameters

Documents served via a cache URL, e.g. cdn.ampproject.org/v/, will include the Viewer integration script. This script adds behavior and enables communication with a parent Viewer.

`cap`<br/>
A comma delimited list of capabilities supported by the Viewer. Other boolean parameters should be deprecated and replaced with an entry in cap.

### Messaging

The AMP Viewer and AMP document communicate via [postMessage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/postMessage).

#### Viewer Integration Messages

The messages in this section are sent by the Viewer Integration Script and are not used by the AMP runtime.
