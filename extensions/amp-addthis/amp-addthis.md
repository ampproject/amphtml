# amp-addthis

## Usage

The `amp-addthis` component provides integration of
[AddThis share buttons](https://www.addthis.com/get/share/) in AMP pages. Website visitors use AddThis share buttons to share content to over 200 social channels including Messenger, WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest and more.

### Share Buttons

#### Floating

Placed on the sides, top, or bottom of your page, following your reader as they scroll. A great way to promote sharing without getting too in-your-face.

Example:

```html
<!--
  This example uses a placeholder pubId.
  Please replace the pubId value with your own after
  creating an account on https://www.addthis.com/dashboard.
-->
<amp-addthis
  width="320"
  height="92"
  layout="responsive"
  data-pub-id="ra-5c191331410932ff"
  data-widget-id="957l"
  data-widget-type="floating"
>
</amp-addthis>
```

#### Inline

Integrate share buttons into your content for a seamless sharing experience.

Example:

```html
<!--
  This example uses a placeholder pubId.
  Please replace the pubId value with your own after
  creating an account on https://www.addthis.com/dashboard.
-->
<amp-addthis
  width="320"
  height="92"
  data-pub-id="ra-5c191331410932ff"
  data-widget-id="mv93"
  data-widget-type="inline"
>
</amp-addthis>
```

### Implementation Documentation

1. If you haven’t already, you will need to [create an AddThis account](https://www.addthis.com/register). Creating an AddThis account is entirely free and allows you to access AddThis' entire suite of website tools as well as our in-depth analytics reports to better understand your site’s social traffic.
2. Go to your [dashboard](https://addthis.com/dashboard) and customize your Share Buttons (AMP currently only supports Floating & Inline Share Buttons).
3. Customize your sharing buttons to your liking, then hit “activate tool”. This will redirect you to our Get The Code page.
4. Last but not least, copy and paste the inline code into the body section of your page where you want the share buttons to appear. For the Floating Share Buttons, you can place this code anywhere in the body as it will automatically appear on either the left or right side of your screen, depending on where you’ve set it in the tool’s settings.

And that’s it! You should see the share buttons appearing on your page!
