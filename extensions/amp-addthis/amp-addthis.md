## Behavior

The `amp-addthis` component provides the ability to embed AddThis website tools (for example, 
sharing buttons, follow buttons, related posts, etc.) on an AMP page.

Example:
```html
<amp-addthis
  width="320"
  height="92"
  data-pub-id="ra-59c2c366435ef478"
  data-widget-id="0fyg">
</amp-addthis>
```

## Attributes

**data-pub-id**

The AddThis publisher ID found in the URL in the [AddThis dashboard](https://addthis.com/dashboard)
after logging in. For example, in the URL `https://www.addthis.com/dashboard#gallery/pub/ra-55e761259a1acdc2`,
`ra-55e761259a1acdc2` is the publisher ID.

**data-widget-id**

The AddThis widget ID for the tool to be displayed, also found on the [AddThis dashboard](https://addthis.com/dashboard).
The widget Id for a specific tool can be found by opening that tool in the AddThis dashboard and
copying the last part of the URL. For example, in the URL `https://www.addthis.com/dashboard#tool-config/pub/ra-55e761259a1acdc2/widgetId/xz1d`,
`xz1d` is the widget Id.

## Validation

See amp-addthis rules in the AMP validator specification.
