  <script
    async
    custom-element="amp-story-player"
    src="https://cdn.ampproject.org/v0/amp-story-player-0.1.js"

      Stories in AMP - Hello World
    </a>
  </amp-story-player>
</body>
```

Place the story's title within the `<a>` tag. This provides a better user experience and allows search engines to crawl embedded stories.
