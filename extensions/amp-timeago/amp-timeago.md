# amp-timeago

## Usage

Use the amp-timago component to count up to, or away from, a specified date and time.

The component replaces the text node with a fuzzy timestamp, such as `in 30 years` or `3 hours ago`.

Example:

[example preview="inline" playground="true" imports="amp-timeago"]

```html
<amp-timeago
  layout="fixed"
  width="160"
  height="20"
  datetime="2017-04-11T00:37:33.809Z"
  locale="en"
>
  Saturday 11 April 2017 00.37
</amp-timeago>
```

[/example]

The `amp-timeago` component requires a placeholder in the text node. The calculated timestamp replaces the placeholder once ready. Use the placeholder as a fallback to display to users if `amp-timeago` is unable to process the fuzzy timestamp.
