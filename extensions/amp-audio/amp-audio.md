## Behavior

The `amp-audio` component loads the audio resource specified by its `src` attribute at a time determined by the runtime. It can be controlled in much the same way as a standard HTML5 `audio` tag.
Like all embedded external resources in an AMP file, the audio is "lazily" loaded, only when the `amp-audio` element is in or near the viewport

The `amp-audio` component accepts up to three unique types of HTML nodes as children:

- `source` tags: Just like in the HTML `<audio>` tag, you can add `<source>` tag children to specify different source media files to play.
-  a placeholder for before the audio starts: One or zero immediate child nodes can have the `placeholder` attribute. If present, this node and its children form a placeholder that will display instead of the audio. A click or tap anywhere inside of the `amp-audio` container will replace the placeholder with the audio itself.
-  a fallback if the browser doesn’t support HTML5 audio: One or zero immediate child nodes can have the `fallback` attribute. If present, this node and its children form the content that displays if HTML5 audio is not supported on the user’s browser.

For example:
```html
<amp-audio width="400" height="300" src="https://yourhost.com/audios/myaudio.mp3">
  <div fallback>
    <p>Your browser doesn’t support HTML5 audio</p>
  </div>
  <source type="audio/mpeg" src="foo.mp3">
  <source type="audio/ogg" src="foo.ogg">
</amp-audio>
```

## Attributes

##### src 

Required if no `<source>` children are present. Must be HTTPS.

##### autoplay

If present, the attribute implies that the audio will start playing as soon as
it is ready.

##### loop

If present, the audio will automatically loop back to the start upon reaching the end.

##### muted

If present, will mute the audio by default.

##### common attributes

This element includes [common attributes](https://www.ampproject.org/docs/reference/common_attributes) extended to AMP components.

## Validation

See [amp-audio rules](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/blob/master/extensions/amp-audio/validator-amp-audio.protoascii) in the AMP validator specification.
