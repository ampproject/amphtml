## Behavior
All you need to do is to include the 'lightbox' attribute on an `<amp-img>` or `<amp-carousel>`. A typical usage looks like this:

### Lightbox with AMP-IMG

```html
<amp-img src="image1" width=200 height=100 lightbox></amp-img>
<amp-img src="image2" width=200 height=100 lightbox></amp-img>
```

The `<amp-lightbox-gallery>` extension automatically inserts an invisible `<amp-lightbox-gallery>` component (with the id 'amp-lightbox-gallery') into the dom.

It iterates through each item that has the `lightbox` attribute and processes it. If the component is a basic item (e.g. `AMP-IMG`), it will install a tap handler on each basic lightboxed item (`on=tap:amp-lightbox-gallery.activate`) if a tap handler does not already exist. Currently, `<amp-img>` is the only type of basic item supported.

### Lightbox with AMP-CAROUSEL
```html
<amp-carousel lightbox width=1600 height=900 layout=responsive type=slides>
  <amp-img src="image1" width=200 height=100></amp-img>
  <amp-img src="image2" width=200 height=100></amp-img>
  <amp-img src="image3" width=200 height=100></amp-img>
</amp-carousel>
```

`<amp-carousel>` is considered a lightbox container item. To process an `<amp-carousel>` with the `lightbox` attribute,  `<amp-lightbox-gallery>` extension will iterate all of the `<amp-carousel>`'s children, add the `lightbox` attribute and a tap-handler to each child.

### Captions
Lightbox optionally allows the user to specify a caption for each element. These fields are automatically read and displayed by `<amp-lightbox-gallery>` in the following order of priority:
- figcaption (if the lightboxed element is a figure)
- aria-describedby
- alt
- aria-label
- aria-labelledby
