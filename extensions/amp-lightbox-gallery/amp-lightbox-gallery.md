## Behavior
All you need to do is to include the extension script and put the 'lightbox' attribute on an `<amp-img>` or `<amp-carousel>`. A typical usage looks like this:

### Lightbox with `<amp-img>`

```html
<amp-img src="image1" width=200 height=100 lightbox></amp-img>
<amp-img src="image2" width=200 height=100 lightbox></amp-img>
```

The `<amp-lightbox-gallery>` extension automatically inserts an invisible `<amp-lightbox-gallery>` component (with the id 'amp-lightbox-gallery') into the dom.

It iterates through each `<amp-img>` that has the `lightbox` attribute and installs a tap handler on it (`on=tap:amp-lightbox-gallery.activate`) if a tap handler does not already exist. Tapping on any `<amp-img>` will open the image in a lightbox gallery. The lightbox gallery does image-handling (e.g. zoom and pan), enables swiping to navigate between images, and offers a thumbnail gallery view for browsing all picture thumbnails in a grid.

### Lightbox with `<amp-carousel>`
```html
<amp-carousel lightbox width=1600 height=900 layout=responsive type=slides>
  <amp-img src="image1" width=200 height=100></amp-img>
  <amp-img src="image2" width=200 height=100></amp-img>
  <amp-img src="image3" width=200 height=100></amp-img>
</amp-carousel>
```

You can add the `lightbox` attribute on an `<amp-carousel>` to lightbox all of its children. `<amp-lightbox-gallery>` currently supports only carousels containing `<amp-img>` as children. As you navigate through the carousel items in the lightbox, the original carousel slides will be sync-ed so that when the lightbox is closed, you will end up on the same slide as you were on originally. Currently on the the `type='slides'` carousel is supported.

### Captions
Lightbox optionally allows the user to specify a caption for each element. These fields are automatically read and displayed by `<amp-lightbox-gallery>` in the following order of priority:
- figcaption (if the lightboxed element is the child of a figure)
- aria-describedby
- alt
- aria-label
- aria-labelledby
