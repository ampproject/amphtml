# amp-brid-player

An `amp-brid-player` displays the Brid Player used in [Brid.tv](https://www.brid.tv/) Video Platform.

The `width` and `height` attributes determine the aspect ratio of the player embedded in responsive layouts.

```html
<amp-brid-player
  data-partner="264"
  data-player="4144"
  data-video="13663"
  layout="responsive"
  width="480"
  height="270"
>
</amp-brid-player>
```

### `autoplay`

If this attribute is present, and the browser supports autoplay:

-   the video is automatically muted before autoplay starts
-   when the video is scrolled out of view, the video is paused
-   when the video is scrolled into view, the video resumes playback
-   when the user taps the video, the video is unmuted
-   if the user has interacted with the video (e.g., mutes/unmutes,
    pauses/resumes, etc.), and the video is scrolled in or out of view, the
    state of the video remains as how the user left it. For example, if the user
    pauses the video, then scrolls the video out of view and returns to the
    video, the video is still paused.

### `data-partner`

The Brid.tv partner ID.

### `data-player`

The Brid.tv player ID. Specific to every partner.

### `data-video`

The Brid.tv video ID. Embed code must either have `video`, `playlist`, `carousel`
or `outstream` attribute.

### `data-dynamic`

### `dock`

**Requires `amp-video-docking` extension.** If this attribute is present and the
video is playing manually, the video will be "minimized" and fixed to a corner
or an element when the user scrolls out of the video component's visual area.

For more details, see [documentation on the docking extension itself](https://amp.dev/documentation/components/amp-video-docking).
