# Quantcast

## Example

```html
    <amp-consent id="quantcast" layout="nodisplay" type="quantcast">
        <script type="application/json">
          {
            "postPromptUI": "quantcast-post-prompt",
            "clientConfig": {
              "coreConfig": {
                "googleEnabled": true
              }
            }
          }
        </script>
        <div id="quantcast-post-prompt">
          <button on="tap:consent.prompt(consent=quantcast)" role="button">Privacy settings</button>
        </div>
    </amp-consent>
```

## Notes

### `postPromptUI`

The value of `postPromptUI` should be the id of the html tag in which the consent ui will be attached to. In our example above, the value of `postPromptUI` is `quantcast-post-prompt` since we have a div with that id.
