# Customizing your AMP extensions behaviors based on user control

You can use the `<amp-consent>` component to block AMP extensions' `buildCallback` until the user opts in. This means that `buildCallback` is only called after the consent has been accepted, or if the consent prompt has been skipped by the `checkConsentHref` response, when consent is unknown.

AMP allows vendors to customize their extensionsâ€™ behaviors.

## Customizing default consent blocking behaviors

`baseElement.getConsentPolicy()` can be used to inform the AMP runtime to change default consent blocking behaviors.

For example: If the vendor believes that an AMP extension doesn't need to be blocked on user control, overwrite the method with:

```js
getConsentPolicy() {
  return null;
}
```

Or if the vendor believes that an AMP extension should always be blocked on user control with the presence of `<amp-consent>`, overwrite the method with:

```js
getConsentPolicy() {
  return 'default';
}
```

**Note**: Currently, only the 'default' consent policy is supported.

## Advanced blocking behaviors

If the vendor wants to customize an AMP extension behaviors based on user control, use the `getConsentPolicyState` API.

`getConsentPolicyState` returns a promise with one of the following values:
* `null` : no `<amp-consent>` is included
* `CONSENT_POLICY_STATE.UNKNOWN` : The consent state is unknown
* `CONSENT_POLICY_STATE.SUFFICIENT` : The consent is accepted
* `CONSENT_POLICY_STATE.INSUFFICIENT` : The consent is rejected
* `CONSENT_POLICY_STATE.UNKNOWN_NOT_REQUIRED` : The consent state is unknown, and `<amp-consent>` is informed to not prompt UI.

In addition to the consent state, the vendor can also use the
`getConsentPolicySharedData` API to receive additional consent related information about
the user from the page owner. See [this](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/blob/master/extensions/amp-consent/amp-consent.md#response) for details about the `shareData`.
