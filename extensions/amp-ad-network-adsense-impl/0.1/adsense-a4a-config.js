// Because AdSense and DoubleClick are both operated by Google and their A4A

// Most other ad networks will want to put their A4A code entirely in the
// extensions/amp-ad-network-${NETWORK_NAME}-impl directory.

//   - Traditional 3p iframe ad rendering (control) vs A4A rendering

//   - Experiment triggered by an external page, such as the Google Search
//     page vs. triggered internally in the client code.
//   - Doubleclick vs Adsense
// The following two objects contain experiment IDs for the first two

// ads/google/a4a/traffic-experiments.js#googleAdsIsA4AEnabled when it works
// out whether a given ad request is in the overall experiment and, if so,
// which branch it's on.
