    <td>AdSense implementation of AMP Ad tag which requests early by XHR and
    renders natively within the page if a valid AMP Ad is returned.  Should
    not be directly referenced by pages and instead is dynamically loaded
    via the amp-ad tag.  However, in order to remove an async script load
    of this library, publishers can include its script declaration.</td>

#### AMP Consent integration

The `<amp-consent>` element can be used to block the ad request until the user or AMP consent [checkConsentHref](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/blob/master/extensions/amp-consent/amp-consent.md#consent-configuration) end point provide consent state.  After the amp-consent extension has been configured (please refer to its [documentation](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/blob/master/extensions/amp-consent/amp-consent.md)), it can be linked to the amp-ad element via the `data-block-on-consent` attribute.

If the user has responded negatively to the amp-consent component (user rejects the consent prompt), RTC call-outs will not be made and [non-personalized ads](https://support.google.com/dfp_premium/answer/9005435) will be requested.  

If the userâ€™s response to the amp-consent is unknown (user dismisses the consent prompt), by default, no ad requests are sent.  
If `data-npa-on-unknown-consent` is set to true, non-personalized ads will be requested.

See [AdSense Help Center article](https://support.google.com/dfp_premium/answer/7678538) for more information.
