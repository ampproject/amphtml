## Behavior

- There can be only one `<amp-sticky-ad>` in an AMP document. The `<amp-sticky-ad>` should only have one direct child of `<amp-ad>`.
- The sticky ad will appear on the bottom of a page.
- The sticky ad introduces a full width blank container and then fills the sticky ad based on the width and height of the amp-ad.
- The height of the sticky-ad is whatever its child needs up to its max-height.
- The max-height of the sticky-ad is 100px, if the height exceeds 100px then the height would be 100px and overflow content will be hidden.
- The width of the sticky-ad is set to 100% using CSS and cannot be overridden.
- The sticky ad will display after scroll one viewport height from top provided there is at least one more viewport of content available.
- When scrolled to the bottom of the page, the viewport is automatically padded with the additional height of the sticky ad, so that no content is ever hidden.
- The sticky adjust to landscape mode, will center align ad.
- There is an intermediate state for sticky-ad, after it is set to visible and before ad is expected to load. Background can be set to transparent to enhance user experience.
- The sticky ad can be dismissed and removed by a close button.

Example:
```html
<amp-sticky-ad layout="nodisplay">
  <amp-ad width="320"
        height="50"
        type="doubleclick"
        data-slot="/35096353/amptesting/formats/sticky">
  </amp-ad>
</amp-sticky-ad>
```

## Attributes

**layout**

The only permissible value for the `layout` attribute in `amp-sticky-ad` is `nodisplay`.

## Styling

The `amp-sticky-ad` component can be styled with standard CSS.

- If different styles need to be applied to intermediate state and final state. The intermediate state style can be set through css class `amp-sticky-ad` and final state style can set through css class `amp-sticky-ad-loaded`. For example different `background-color` for these two states.
- Close button style can be set through css class `amp-sticky-ad-close-button`.
