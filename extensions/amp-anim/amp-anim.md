## Behavior

The `amp-anim` component is almost identical to the `amp-img` element, but allows the AMP runtime to reduce CPU usage when the animation is off-screen. Like [other elements](https://www.ampproject.org/docs/guides/author-develop/responsive/placeholders), it supports an optional `placeholder` child, to display while the `src` file is loading:

```html
<amp-anim width=400 height=300 src="my-gif.gif">
  <amp-img placeholder width=400 height=300 src="my-gif-screencap.jpg">
  </amp-img>
</amp-anim>
```

In the future, additional functionality, such as animation playback control, could be added.

## Attributes

**src**

Similar to the `src` attribute on the `img` tag. The value must be a URL that
points to a publicly-cacheable image file. Cache providers may rewrite these
URLs when ingesting AMP files to point to a cached version of the image.

**srcset**

Same as `srcset` attribute on the `img` tag.

**alt**

A string of alternate text, similar to the `alt` attribute on `img`.

**attribution**

A string that indicates the attribution of the image. For example, `attribution="CC courtesy of Cats on Flicker"`.

**height** and **width**

An explicit size of the image, which is used by the AMP runtime to determine the aspect ratio without fetching the image. 

**common attributes**

This element includes [common attributes](https://www.ampproject.org/docs/reference/common_attributes) extended to AMP components.


## Styling

`amp-img` can be styled directly via CSS properties. Setting a grey background
placeholder for example could be achieved via:
```css
amp-anim {
  background-color: grey;
}
```
## Validation

See [amp-anim rules](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/blob/master/extensions/amp-anim/0.1/validator-amp-anim.protoascii) in the AMP validator specification.
