# amp-user-location

## Behavior

The `amp-user-location` component can be used in combination with other components to
send the user's location as part of other AMP components' requests. For example, to send the user's
location with a form or an analytics request, the Variable Substitution variables can be used.

## Attributes

The `amp-user-location` component only requires an `id` attribute.

## AMP Actions

`amp-user-location` exposes the `request` action. This action is required to send the user's location
to another AMP component. This will cause the browser to prompt the user to approve location access
for the current domain, if the user has not already.

```html
<button on="tap: location.request()">Use my location</button>
<amp-user-location id="location" on="approve:â€¦" layout="nodisplay">
</amp-user-location>
```

## AMP Events

`amp-user-location` exposes the following events

<table>
  <tr>
    <th width="30%">Event</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>approve</code></td>
    <td>This event is fired when the user triggers the `request` action and then approves the browser prompt to access their location, or the user has previously approved the prompt. The `event` object contains `lat` `lon` and `source` properties.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>deny</code></td>
    <td>This event is fired when the user triggers the `request` action and then denies the browser prompt to access their location, or the user has previously denied the prompt.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>error</code></td>
    <td>This event is fired when the user triggers the `request` action and and error occurs. This can happen if the browser takes too long to retrieve the location information, if the hardware is unavailable, or other errors occur.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

## Variable Substitution

The user's location is also available via AMP variable substitution:

`AMP_USER_LOCATION` or `${ampUserLocation}` returns the latitude and longitude separated by a comma.
`AMP_USER_LOCATION(LAT)` or `${ampUserLocation(LAT)}` returns the latitude.
`AMP_USER_LOCATION(LON)` or `${ampUserLocation(LON)}` returns the longitude.
`AMP_USER_LOCATION(SOURCE)` or `${ampUserLocation(SOURCE)}` returns the source. The source may be one of `debug`, `fallback`, `geolocation`, `unavailable`, or `unsupported`.

The `AMP_USER_LOCATION_POLL` or `${ampUserLocationPoll}` substitution is also available with the same
syntax as above. It will wait for the location to be requested before resolving, and will prevent a
request from occurring until that time. Polling is useful when the location is required for the request.

## Validation

See [amp-user-location rules](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/blob/master/extensions/amp-user-location/validator-amp-user-location.protoascii) in the AMP validator specification.
