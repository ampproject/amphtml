## Usage

Use `<amp-video-iframe>` to embed a video player that has no stand-alone AMP component or to embed your own custom JavaScript-based video player. See the list of [third-party stand-alone components here](TODO). 

The example below demonstrates how to use `amp-video-iframe` in your AMP document:

```html
<amp-video-iframe
  layout="responsive"
  width="16"
  height="9"
  src="/my-video-player.html"
  poster="/my-video-poster.jpg"
>
</amp-video-iframe>
```

The `src` attribute points to `my-video-player.html`, the inner document loaded inside the iframe. This document plays the video. It must include and bootstrap an [integration script](TODO). The integration script allows `<amp-video-iframe>` to coordinate the video's playback.

The `<amp-video-iframe>` component differs from [`<amp-iframe>`](../amp-iframe/amp-iframe.md) and non-AMP iframeas in the following ways:

- `<amp-video-iframe>` implements all [video features](../../spec/amp-video-interface.md). Features include but are not limited to autoplay, minimize-to-corner and rotate-to-fullscreen.
- `<amp-video-iframe>` must request resources via HTTPS.
- `<amp-video-iframe>` is not scrollable.
- `<amp-video-iframe>` enforces sandboxing to itself and child iframes. This discourages misuse of <amp-video-iframe> as a means for advertising. 

### Video player integration

The `<amp-video-iframe>` component requires the embedded html document to include the [video-iframe-integration library](todo). The library is separate from the component's required script. This is because the embedded html document is non-AMP and iframed.

```html
<script
  async
  src="https://cdn.ampproject.org/video-iframe-integration-v0.js"
></script>

<!-- Wait for API to initialize -->
<script>
  (window.AmpVideoIframe = window.AmpVideoIframe || []).push(
    onAmpIntegrationReady
  );

  function onAmpIntegrationReady(ampIntegration) {
    // `ampIntegration` is an object containing the tools required to integrate.
    // This callback specifies how the AMP document and the iframed video document
    // talk to each other.
    // YOU NEED TO IMPLEMENT THIS. See below.
  }
</script>
```

Provide a callback that specifies how the AMP document and the iframes video document communicate. You must implement a set of playback methods and event dispatchers to sync the documents together. Implement support by:

- Using an existing [third party provided readymade integration](todo).
- Writing a [custom integration](todo) if your solution doesn't use supported tools.
- [Contributing a third party integration](todo) for future use.  

#### Third party integrations

Third party video frameworks contributed their integrations for use with `<amp-video-iframe>`.

##### [JwPlayer](https://developer.jwplayer.com/jwplayer/docs)

Pass your [`jwplayer` instance object](https://developer.jwplayer.com/jw-player/docs/javascript-api-reference/)
through the signature `ampIntegration.listenTo('jwplayer', myJwplayer)`. The `ampIntegration` object setups the player through the instance API.

```js
function onAmpIntegrationReady(ampIntegration) {
  var myJwplayer = jwplayer('my-video');
  ampIntegration.listenTo('jwplayer', myJwplayer);
}
```


##### [Video.js](https://videojs.com/)

Pass your [`<video>` element](https://docs.videojs.com/docs/api/player.html)
through the signature `ampIntegration.listenTo('videojs', myVideo)`. Video.js overloads this element to provide methods
that the `ampIntegration` object uses to setup the player.

```js
function onAmpIntegrationReady(ampIntegration) {
  var myVideo = document.querySelector('#my-video');
  ampIntegration.listenTo('videojs', myVideo);
}
```

`listenTo` initializes the Video.js instance on the `<video>` element if required. This uses the global `videojs` function by default. If your page provides the initializer differently, you must pass it in as the third argument:

```js
function onAmpIntegrationReady(ampIntegration) {
  var myVideo = document.querySelector('#my-video');

  // ampIntegration initializes player with `myVideojsInitializer(myVideo)`
  ampIntegration.listenTo('videojs', myVideo, myVideojsInitializer);
}
```

#### Custom integrations

You can create a custom implementation for your solution to communicate with `<amp-video-iframe>`. 

The following communication methods are available:

- [`method`](#method) to control playback.
- [`postEvent`](#postEvent) to inform the host document about playback events.
- [`getIntersection`](#getIntersection) to get video's viewability on the host document.
- [`getMetadata`](#getMetadata) to get information about the host document.

##### <a name="method"></a> `method(name, callback)`

Implements a method that calls playback functions on the video. For example:

```js
ampIntegration.method('play', function() {
  myVideo.play();
});
```

You should implement these methods:

- `play`
- `pause`
- `mute`
- `unmute`
- `showcontrols`
- `hidecontrols`
- `fullscreenenter`
- `fullscreenexit`

Enabling playback [actions](https://amp.dev/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/learn/amp-actions-and-events/) require the `play` and `pause` methods. 

Use of `autoplay` requires `play`, `pause`, `mute` and `unmute`.

When minimizing the video to the corner, it displays a custom controls overlay. Use `showcontrols` and `hidecontrols` for the best possible user experience and avoid showing two sets of controls. 

Allow users to enter and exit fullscreen viewing by enabling `fullscreenenter` and `fullscreenexit`.

#### <a name="postEvent"></a> `postEvent(name)`

Posts a playback event to the frame. For example:

```js
myVideoElement.addEventListener('pause', function() {
  ampIntegration.postEvent('pause');
});
```

The valid events are as follows.

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <td>Event</td>
      <td>Description</td>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><code>canplay</code></td>
      <td>
        Triggered when your player is ready. This event must be posted before
        the player can become interactive.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>playing</code></td>
      <td>
        Triggered when your player has started playing a video after load or
        pause.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>pause</code></td>
      <td>
        Triggered when your video has been paused.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>ended</code></td>
      <td>
        Triggered when your video has ended playback. Note that you must also
        post a <code>pause</code> event alongside the <code>ended</code> event.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>muted</code></td>
      <td>
        Triggered when your video has been muted.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>unmuted</code></td>
      <td>
        Triggered when your video has been unmuted.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>ad_start</code></td>
      <td>
        Triggered when a pre/mid/post-roll ad is playing. This hides the
        autoplay shim displayed on the video.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>ad_end</code></td>
      <td>
        Triggered when a pre/mid/post-roll ad has ended. This re-displays the
        autoplay shim if the user has not yet interacted with the video.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

#### <a name="postAnalyticsEvent"></a> `postAnalyticsEvent(eventType[, vars])`

Posts a custom analytics event to be consumed by `amp-analytics`. The
`eventType` must be prefixed with `video-custom-` to prevent naming collisions
with other analytics event types.

This method takes an optional `vars` param that should define an object with
custom variables to log. These are available as `VIDEO_STATE`, keyed by name
prefixed with `custom_`, i.e. the object `{myVar: 'foo'}` will be available as
`{'custom_myVar': 'foo}`.

#### <a name="getIntersection"></a> `getIntersection(callback)`

Gets the intersection ratio (between 0 and 1) for the video element. This is useful for viewability information, e.g.

```js
// Will log intersection every 2 seconds
setInterval(function() {
  integration.getIntersection(function(intersection) {
    console.log('Intersection ratio:', intersection.intersectionRatio);
  });
}, 2000);
```

The `callback` passed to the function will be executed with an object that looks
like this:

```json
{"time": 33333.33, "intersectionRatio": 0.761}
```

âš  This should be considered a low-fidelity reading. Currently, the value for
`intersectionRatio` will be 0 as long as the video is under 50% visible. This
value is bound to change at any time, and the callbacks may be delayed or
debounced.

#### <a name="getMetadata"></a> `getMetadata()`

Returns an object containing metadata about the host document:

```json
{
  "canonicalUrl": "foo.html",
  "sourceUrl": "bar.html"
}
```


### Disallowed usage of `<amp-video-iframe>`

Use `<amp-video-iframe>` to embed a video player. Do not use it to embed a video directly or for advertisement purposes. 

#### Embed a video directly 

Use `<amp-video>` to directly embed a video on the AMP document.

#### Advertising 

Use `<amp-ad>` for advertising purposes. `<amp-video-iframe>` may display videos where part of the videos is advertising.

Do not use `<amp-video-iframe>` for the _primary purpose_ of displaying advertising.  This component is not rendered when in violation of this policy. The reasons for this policy:

- `<amp-video-iframe> `enforces sandboxing to itself and child iframes. This means landing pages may break, even if the ad itself appears to work.

- `<amp-video-iframe>` has no controlled resize mechanism.

</table>

## Usage

Include an `amp-video-iframe` on your AMP document:

```html
<amp-video-iframe
  layout="responsive"
  width="16"
  height="9"
  src="/my-video-player.html"
  poster="/my-video-poster.jpg"
>
</amp-video-iframe>
```

`my-video-player.html` is the inner document loaded inside the frame that plays the video. This document must include and bootstrap [an integration script](#integration) so that the AMP document including the `<amp-video-iframe>` can coordinate the video's playback.

### <a id="vendors"></a> Third-party video vendors

If you're a vendor that does _not_ provide a [custom video player component](../../spec/amp-video-interface.md), you can integrate with AMP in the form of an `amp-video-iframe` configuration, so authors can embed video provided through your service.

Note: For most video providers, `amp-video-iframe` provides enough tools for common playback actions (see [methods](#method) and [events](#postEvent)). Refer to the [vendor player spec](../../spec/amp-3p-video.md) for more details on whether you can use `amp-video-iframe` or you should build a third-party player component instead.

As a vendor, you can serve a generic [integration document](#integration) that references provided videos via URL parameters. AMP authors who use your video service only need to include an `<amp-video-iframe>` tag in their documents:

```html
<!--
  data-param-* attributes are added to src and poster, so this would use the
  following composed urls:

  src: https://vendor.example/amp-video-iframe
      ?videoid=MY_VIDEO_ID
      &channelid=MY_CHANNEL_ID

  poster: https://vendor.example/poster.jpg
      ?videoid=MY_VIDEO_ID
      &channelid=MY_CHANNEL_ID
-->
<amp-video-iframe
  layout="responsive"
  width="16"
  height="9"
  src="https://vendor.example/amp-video-iframe"
  poster="https://vendor.example/poster.jpg"
  data-param-videoid="MY_VIDEO_ID"
  data-param-channelid="MY_CHANNEL_ID"
>
</amp-video-iframe>
```

The `src` and `poster` URLs are appended with [`data-param-*` attributes as query string](#data-param).

The `/amp-video-iframe` document bootstraps the [integration script](#integration) so that the AMP document can coordinate with the player.

Note: If you're a vendor hosting an integration document, feel free to [contribute a code sample to this page,](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/blob/master/extensions/amp-video-iframe/amp-video-iframe.md) specifying your provided
`src` and usable `data-param-*` attributes.

## <a id="integration"></a> Integration inside the frame

In order for the video integration to work, the embedded document (e.g. `my-video-player.html`) must include a small library:

```html
<script
  async
  src="https://cdn.ampproject.org/video-iframe-integration-v0.js"
></script>

<!-- Wait for API to initialize -->
<script>
  (window.AmpVideoIframe = window.AmpVideoIframe || []).push(
    onAmpIntegrationReady
  );

  function onAmpIntegrationReady(ampIntegration) {
    // `ampIntegration` is an object containing the tools required to integrate.
    // This callback specifies how the AMP document and the iframed video document
    // talk to each other.
    // YOU NEED TO IMPLEMENT THIS. See below.
  }
</script>
```

Note that this library is separate from the extension code (`amp-video-iframe-0.1.js`), because
it lives on the non-AMP document that is iframed.

The provided callback specifies how the AMP document and the iframed video document talk to each other. You need to implement a set of
playback methods and event dispatchers to plug these together. For common video frameworks, the integration script
[provides readymade playback support](#readymade-integrations), but you can also [write a custom integration yourself](#custom-integrations) if you don't use any of the tools for which support is available.

{% call callout('Do not autoplay yourself', type='caution') %}
**Never play the video inside the frame automatically.** Instead, you should support the integration script and use the `amp-video-iframe` tag with the `autoplay` attribute. The AMP component will automatically send the necessary signals to your iframe to autoplay for a better user experience.
{% endcall %}

### Readymade integrations

If you're using a common video framework like [JwPlayer](https://www.jwplayer.com/) or [Video.js](http://videojs.com/), you can call **`listenTo()`** for a basic, readymade integration. These integrations support all playback and UI controls when the framework provides them, see each for supported methods.

{% call callout('Framework APIs', type='note') %}
Depending on which video framework you use, you'll call the `listenTo` method differently. Read on the specific APIs below.
{% endcall %}

{% call callout('Expanded support', type='note') %}
You can additionally use [custom integration methods](#custom-integrations) if you require a feature not available in readymade implementations.
{% endcall %}

##### For JwPlayer

**Default supported events:** `ad_end`/`ad_start`, `canplay`, `error`, `muted`/`unmuted`, `pause`/`playing`

**Default supported methods:** `pause`/`play`, `mute`/`unmute`, `hidecontrols`/`showcontrols`, `fullscreenenter`/`fullscreenexit`

Pass in your [`jwplayer` instance object](https://developer.jwplayer.com/jw-player/docs/javascript-api-reference/)
through the signature `ampIntegration.listenTo('jwplayer', myJwplayer)`. The `ampIntegration` object then knows how
to setup the player through the instance API.

```js
function onAmpIntegrationReady(ampIntegration) {
  var myJwplayer = jwplayer('my-video');
  ampIntegration.listenTo('jwplayer', myJwplayer);
}
```

##### For Video.js

**Default supported events:** `canplay`, `ended`, `muted`/`unmuted`, `pause`/`playing`

**Default supported methods:** `pause`/`play`, `mute`/`unmute`, `hidecontrols`/`showcontrols`, `fullscreenenter`/`fullscreenexit`

Pass in your [`<video>` element](https://docs.videojs.com/docs/api/player.html)
through the signature `ampIntegration.listenTo('videojs', myVideo)`. Video.js overloads this element to provide methods
that the `ampIntegration` object uses to setup the player.

```js
function onAmpIntegrationReady(ampIntegration) {
  var myVideo = document.querySelector('#my-video');
  ampIntegration.listenTo('videojs', myVideo);
}
```

`listenTo` initializes the Video.js instance on the `<video>` element if required. This uses the global `videojs` function by default. If your page provides the initializer differently, you must pass it in as the third argument:

```js
function onAmpIntegrationReady(ampIntegration) {
  var myVideo = document.querySelector('#my-video');

  // ampIntegration initializes player with `myVideojsInitializer(myVideo)`
  ampIntegration.listenTo('videojs', myVideo, myVideojsInitializer);
}
```

### Custom integrations

If you don't use any of the [video frameworks supported by default](#readymade-integrations), you must write a custom implementation to talk to AMP's video management.

These are the communication methods available:

- [`method`](#method) to control playback.
- [`postEvent`](#postEvent) to inform the host document about playback events.
- [`getIntersection`](#getIntersection) to get video's viewability on the host document.
- [`getMetadata`](#getMetadata) to get information about the host document.

If you use a supported framework, it's possible to have more fine-grained control over the default implementation by using these same methods.

#### <a name="method"></a> `method(name, callback)`

Implements a method that calls playback functions on the video. For example:

```js
ampIntegration.method('play', function() {
  myVideo.play();
});
```

These are methods that should be implemented:

- `play`
- `pause`
- `mute`
- `unmute`
- `showcontrols`
- `hidecontrols`
- `fullscreenenter`
- `fullscreenexit`

You can choose to only implement this interface partially, with a few caveats:

- `play` and `pause` are required for either/both of playback [actions](https://amp.dev/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/learn/amp-actions-and-events/) or autoplay.

- `mute` and `unmute` are required for autoplay.

- `showcontrols` and `hidecontrols` are required for the best possible UX. For
  example, when minimizing the video to the corner, a custom controls overlay is
  shown. If you don't provide methods to hide and show controls, two sets of
  controls could be displayed at the same time, which is a poor user experience.

- `fullscreenenter` and `fullscreenexit` are required for best possible UX. For
  example, for `rotate-to-fullscreen` or the fullscreen button on minimized
  video.

#### <a name="postEvent"></a> `postEvent(name)`

Posts a playback event to the frame. For example:

```js
myVideoElement.addEventListener('pause', function() {
  ampIntegration.postEvent('pause');
});
```

The valid events are as follows.

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <td>Event</td>
      <td>Description</td>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><code>canplay</code></td>
      <td>
        Triggered when your player is ready. This event must be posted before
        the player can become interactive.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>playing</code></td>
      <td>
        Triggered when your player has started playing a video after load or
        pause.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>pause</code></td>
      <td>
        Triggered when your video has been paused.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>ended</code></td>
      <td>
        Triggered when your video has ended playback. Note that you must also
        post a <code>pause</code> event alongside the <code>ended</code> event.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>muted</code></td>
      <td>
        Triggered when your video has been muted.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>unmuted</code></td>
      <td>
        Triggered when your video has been unmuted.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>ad_start</code></td>
      <td>
        Triggered when a pre/mid/post-roll ad is playing. This hides the
        autoplay shim displayed on the video.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>ad_end</code></td>
      <td>
        Triggered when a pre/mid/post-roll ad has ended. This re-displays the
        autoplay shim if the user has not yet interacted with the video.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

#### <a name="postAnalyticsEvent"></a> `postAnalyticsEvent(eventType[, vars])`

Posts a custom analytics event to be consumed by `amp-analytics`. The
`eventType` must be prefixed with `video-custom-` to prevent naming collisions
with other analytics event types.

This method takes an optional `vars` param that should define an object with
custom variables to log. These are available as `VIDEO_STATE`, keyed by name
prefixed with `custom_`, i.e. the object `{myVar: 'foo'}` will be available as
`{'custom_myVar': 'foo}`.

#### <a name="getIntersection"></a> `getIntersection(callback)`

Gets the intersection ratio (between 0 and 1) for the video element. This is useful for viewability information, e.g.

```js
// Will log intersection every 2 seconds
setInterval(function() {
  integration.getIntersection(function(intersection) {
    console.log('Intersection ratio:', intersection.intersectionRatio);
  });
}, 2000);
```

The `callback` passed to the function will be executed with an object that looks
like this:

```json
{"time": 33333.33, "intersectionRatio": 0.761}
```

âš  This should be considered a low-fidelity reading. Currently, the value for
`intersectionRatio` will be 0 as long as the video is under 50% visible. This
value is bound to change at any time, and the callbacks may be delayed or
debounced.

#### <a name="getMetadata"></a> `getMetadata()`

Returns an object containing metadata about the host document:

```json
{
  "canonicalUrl": "foo.html",
  "sourceUrl": "bar.html"
}
```
