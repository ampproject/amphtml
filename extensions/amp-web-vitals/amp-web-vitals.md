## Usage

Allows publishers to capture Real User Metrics.

### Required element structure

#### Add the required `script`

Inside the `<head>...</head>` section of your AMP page, insert the following
code before the line
`<script async src="https://cdn.ampproject.org/v0.js"></script>`.

```html
<script
  async
  custom-element="amp-web-vitals"
  src="https://cdn.ampproject.org/v0/amp-web-vitals-0.1.js`"
></script>
```

#### Add the `amp-link-rewriter` component

Inside the `<body>...</body>` section of your AMP page, insert code as shown
below the example (it has to be customized for every vendor use case):

```html
<amp-web-vitals layout="nodisplay">
    <script type="application/json">
      {
        "type": "local",
        "url": "http://www.example.com",
      }
    </script>
  </amp-web-vitals>
```

#### Full example

The final code should look like:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html âš¡>
  <head>
    ...
    <script
      async
      custom-element="amp-web-vitals"
      src="https://cdn.ampproject.org/v0/amp-web-vitals-0.1.js`"
    ></script>
    ...
    <script async src="https://cdn.ampproject.org/v0.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    ...
    <amp-web-vitals layout="nodisplay">
        <script type="application/json">
          {
            "type": "local",
            "url": "http://www.example.com",
          }
        </script>
      </amp-web-vitals>
    ....
  </body>
</html>
```

### JSON configuration

The `type` property (required) has to be a string value and can either be 'local' or 'remote'. 
'local' means that the Web Vitals metrics will get output onto the Browser console. 
'remote' means that the Web Vitals metrics will be sent to a remote endpoint for logging. 

The 'url' property (required) has to be a string value, and should be the url of the currently displayed web page.

The 'remote_service_url' property (required if `type` is `remote`) has to be a string value and should be
the url of a remote endpoint capable of logging the eb vitals metrics sent to it in a POST request parameter.

The 'tags' property (optional) has to be an array of strings. These strings can be any data you want to pass
along the Web Vitals metric to the remote endpoint.

Full example:

```html
<amp-web-vitals>
  <script type="application/json">
        {
          "type": "remote",
          "url": "http://www.example.com",
          "remote_service_url": "http://remote-service.com/endpoint",
          "tags": ["tag1", "tag2"]
        }
      </script>
</amp-web-vitals>
```
