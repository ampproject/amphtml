# <a name="amp-analytics"></a> Variables supported in `amp-analytics`

Use the format `${varName}` in a request string for a page or platform-defined variable. The `amp-analytics` tag will replace the template with its actual value at the time of construction of the analytics request.

Since the request that is constructed is sent over HTTP, the request needs to be encoded. To achieve this, the `var` values are url-encoded using [`encodeUrlComponent`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/encodeURIComponent) before being inserted into the request.

## Variable definitions
Vars can be defined by the platform, in the config at the top level, inside the triggers or in a remote config, as shown in this example.

```html
<amp-analytics config="http://example.com/config.json">
<script type="application/json">
{
  "requests": {
    "pageview": "https://example.com/analytics?url=${canonicalUrl}&title=${title}&acct=${account}&clientId=${clientId(cid-scope)}",
  },
  "vars": {
    "account": "ABC123",
    "title": "Homepage"
  },
  "triggers": {
    "some-event": {
      "on": "visible",
      "request": "pageview",
      "vars": {
        "title": "My homepage",
        "clientId": "my user"
      }
  }
}
</script>
</amp-analytics>
```

## Variables as data attribute
For the following event types, variables can be passed as part of the element level data attribute

* visible
* click

The variables passed as data attributes should follow the format `data-vars-*`.

Example:

`<span id="test1" class="box" data-vars-event-id="22">
  Click here to generate an event
</span>`

And in the request url the token would be of the format `${eventId}` (follows camelcase).

When the same `var` is defined in multiple locations, the value is picked in the order remote config > element level data attributes > triggers > top level > platform. Thus, if the remote config defined `clientId` as `12332312` in the example above, the values of various vars will be as follows:

| var | Value | Defined by |
|-------|-------|------------|
|canonicalUrl | http://example.com/path/to/the/page | Platform |
|title | My homepage | Trigger |
|account | ABC123 | Top level config |
|clientId | 12332312 | Remote config |

The remainder of this doc lists and describes the variables supported in `amp-analytics`.

Example value: `1452710304312`


### backgroundState

When used, will provide the current backgrounded state of the page.

Possible values are 0, the page is visible, or 1, the page is backgrounded.

## Visibility Variables

### backgrounded

A binary variable with possible values of 1 and 0 to indicate that the page/tab was sent to background at any point before the hit was sent. 1 indicates that the page was backgrounded while 0 indicates that the page has always been in the foreground. This variable does not count prerender as a backgrounded state.

### backgroundedAtStart

A binary variable with possible values of 1 and 0 to indicate that the page/tab was backgrounded at the time when the page was loaded. 1 indicates that the page was loaded in the background while 0 indicates otherwise. This variable does not count prerender as a backgrounded state.

### maxContinuousVisibleTime

Provides the maximum amount of continuous time an element has met the `visibilitySpec` conditions at the time this ping is sent. Note that a ping with a continuousTimeMin=1000 and totalTimeMin=5000 that is visible for 1000ms, then not visible, then visible
for 2000ms, then not, then visible for 1000ms, then not, then visible for 1020ms
will report 2000 for this number as that is the max continuous visible time,
even if it is not the current continuous visible time (1020 in this example).

### elementHeight

Provides the height of the element specified by `visibilitySpec`.

### elementWidth

Provides the width of the element specified by `visibilitySpec`.

### elementX

Provides the X coordinate of the left edge of the element specified by `visibilitySpec`.

### elementY

Provides the Y coordinate of the top edge of the element specified by `visibilitySpec`.

### firstSeenTime

Provides the time when at least 1px of the element is on the screen for the first time since the trigger is registered by `amp-analytics`.

### firstVisibleTime

Provides the time when the element met visibility conditions for the first time since
the trigger is registered by `amp-analytics`.

### lastSeenTime

Provides the time when at least 1px of the element is on the screen for the last time since javascript load.

### lastVisibleTime

Provides the time when the element met visibility conditions for the last time since
javascript load.

### loadTimeVisibility

Provides the percentage of element visible in the viewport at load time. This variable assumes that the page is scrolled to top.

### maxVisiblePercentage

Provides the maximum visible percentage over the time that `visibilitySpec` conditions were met. For example, a ping where the element was 100%, then off the page, then 100% will report this value as 100. A ping with visiblePercentageMax=50 undergoing the same transitions would report somewhere between 0 and 50 since any time when the element was 100% on the page would not be counted.

### minVisiblePercentage

Provides the minimum visible percentage over the time that visibilitySpec conditions were met. For example, a ping where the element was 100%, then off the page, then 100% will report this value as 0. A ping with visiblePercentageMin=50 condition undergoing the same transitions would report somewhere between 50 and 100 since any time when the element was 0% to 50% on the page would not be counted.

### totalTime

Provides the total time from the time page was loaded to the time a ping was sent out. The value is calculated from the time document became interactive.

### totalVisibleTime

Provides the total time for which the element has met the visiblitySpec conditions at time this ping is sent.

### fromSlide

Provides the slide from which the traversal happens. The value is either taken from the `data-slide-id` attribute of the slide when present, else it represents the index of the slide (starting from 0).

### toSlide

Provides the slide to which the traversal happens. The value is either taken from the `data-slide-id` attribute of the slide when present, else it represents the index of the slide (starting from 0).
