## <a name="behavior"></a>Behavior

The `<amp-analytics>` element is used to measure activity on an AMP document. The details concerning what is measured and how that data is sent to an analytics server is specified in a JSON configuration object. It comes pre-configured to support many [analytics vendors](#analytics-vendors) out of the box.

For example, the following `<amp-analytics>` element is configured to send a request to `https://example.com/analytics`
when the document is first loaded, and each time an `<a>` tag is clicked:

```html
<amp-analytics>
<script type="application/json">
{
  "requests": {
    "pageview": "https://example.com/analytics?url=${canonicalUrl}&title=${title}&acct=${account}",
    "event": "https://example.com/analytics?eid=${eventId}&elab=${eventLabel}&acct=${account}"
  },
  "vars": {
    "account": "ABC123"
  },
  "triggers": {
    "trackPageview": {
      "on": "visible",
      "request": "pageview"
    },
    "trackAnchorClicks": {
      "on": "click",
      "selector": "a",
      "request": "event",
      "vars": {
        "eventId": "42",
        "eventLabel": "clicked on a link"
      }
    }
  }
}
</script>
</amp-analytics>
```

## Analytics vendors

By specifying the name of an analytics vendor with the `type` attribute you can quickly configure `amp-analytics` to use the respective product. Additional configuration (such as your user id) may still be necessary.

Here's an example of usage of `type` for a provider called XYZ:

```html
<amp-analytics type="XYZ"> ... </amp-analytics>
```

## <a name="attributes"></a>Attributes

  - `type` See [Analytics vendors](#analytics-vendors)
  - `config` Optional attribute. This attribute can be used to load a configuration from a specified remote URL. The URL specified here should use https scheme. See also `data-include-credentials` attribute below. The URL may include [AMP URL vars](../../spec/amp-var-substitutions.md).

    `<amp-analytics config="https://example.com/analytics.config.json"></amp-analytics>`

    The response must follow the [AMP CORS security guidelines](../../spec/amp-cors-requests.md).
  - `data-credentials` Optional attribute. If set to `include` turns on the ability to read and write cookies on the request specified via `config` above.
  - `data-consent-notification-id` Optional attribute. If provided, the page will not process analytics requests until an [amp-user-notification](../../extensions/amp-user-notification/amp-user-notification.md) with
    the given HTML element id is confirmed (accepted) by the user.

## Configuration

Configuration may be specified inline (as shown in the example above) or fetched remotely by specifying a URL in the
`config` attribute. Additionally, built-in configuration for popular analytics vendors can be selected using
the `type` attribute.

If configuration data from more than one of these sources is used, the configuration objects (vars, requests and triggers) will
be merged together such that **(i) remote configuration takes precedence over inline configuration and (ii) inline configuration
takes precedence over vendor configuration**.

The `<amp-analytics>` configuration object uses the following format:

```javascript
{
  "requests": {
    request-name: request-value,
    ...
  },
  "vars": {
    var-name: var-value,
    ...
  },
  "triggers": {
    trigger-name: trigger-object,
    ...
  },
  "transport": {
    "beacon": *boolean*,
    "xhrpost": *boolean*,
    "image": *boolean*
  }
}
```
### Requests
The `requests` attribute specifies the URLs used to transmit data to an analytics platform. The `request-name` is used
in the trigger configuration to specify what request should be sent in response to a particular event. The `request-value`
is an https URL. These values may include placeholder tokens that can reference other requests or variables.

```javascript
"requests": {
  "base": "https://example.com/analytics?a=${account}&u=${canonicalUrl}&t=${title}",
  "pageview": "${base}&type=pageview",
  "event": "${base}&type=event&eventId=${eventId}"
}
```

### Vars

`amp-analytics` defines many basic variables that can be used in requests. A list of all such variables is available in the  [`amp-analytics` Variables Guide](./analytics-vars.md). In addition, all of the variables supported by [AMP HTML Substitutions Guide](../../spec/amp-var-substitutions.md) are also supported.

The `vars` attribute in the configuration can be used to define new key-value pairs or override existing variables that can be referenced in `request` values. New variables are commonly used to specify publisher specific information.  Arrays can be used to specify a list of values that should be URL encoded separately while preserving the comma delimiter.

```javascript
"vars": {
  "account": "ABC123",
  "countryCode": "tr",
  "tags": ["Swift,Jonathan", "Gulliver's Travels"]
}
```

### Triggers
The `triggers` attribute describes when an analytics request should be sent. It contains a key-value pair of trigger-name and
 trigger-configuration. Trigger name can be any string comprised of alphanumeric characters (a-zA-Z0-9). Triggers from a
 configuration with lower precedence are overridden by triggers with the same names from a configuration with higher precedence.

  - `on` (required) The event to listener for. Valid values are `click`, `scroll`, `timer`, `visible`, and `hidden`.
  - `request` (required) Name of the request to send (as specified in the `requests` section).
  - `vars` An object containing key-value pairs used to override `vars` defined in the top level config, or to specify
    vars unique to this trigger.
  - `selector` (required when `on` is set to `click`) This configuration is used on conjunction with the `click` trigger. Please see below for details.
  - `scrollSpec` (required when `on` is set to `scroll`) This configuration is used on conjunction with the `scroll` trigger. Please see below for details.
  - `timerSpec` (required when `on` is set to `timer`) This configuration is used on conjunction with the `timer` trigger. Please see below for details.
  - `sampleSpec` This object is used to define how the requests can be sampled before they are sent. This setting allows sampling based on random input or other platform supported vars. The object contains configuration to specify an input that is used to generate a hash and a threshold that the hash must meet.
    - `sampleOn` This string template is expanded by filling in the platform variables and then hashed to generate a number for the purposes of the sampling logic described under threshold below.
    - `threshold` This configuration is used to filter out requests that do not meet particular criteria: For a request to go through to the analytics vendor, the following logic should be true `HASH(sampleOn) < threshold`.

  As an example, following configuration can be used to sample 50% of the requests based on random input or at 1% based on client id.
  ```javascript
  'triggers': {
    'sampledOnRandom': {
      'on': 'visible',
      'request': 'request',
      'sampleSpec': {
        'sampleOn': '${random}',
        'threshold': 50,
      },
    },
    'sampledOnClientId': {
      'on': 'visible',
      'request': 'request',
      'sampleSpec': {
        'sampleOn': '${clientId(cookieName)}',
        'threshold': 1,
      },
    },
  },
  ```

#### Page visible trigger (`"on": "visible"`)
Use this configuration to fire a request when the page becomes visible. The firing of this trigger can be configured using `visibilitySpec`.

```javascript
"triggers": {
  "defaultPageview": {
    "on": "visible",
    "request": "pageview",
  }
}
```

##### Visibility Spec
Visibility spec is a set of conditions and properties that can be applied to `visible` or `hidden` triggers to change when they fire. If multiple properties are specified, they must all be true in order for a request to fire. Configuration properties supported in `visibilitySpec` are:
  - `selector` This property can be used to specify the element to which all the `visibilitySpec` conditions apply. The selector needs to point to an [AMP extended  element](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/blob/master/spec/amp-tag-addendum.md#amp-specific-tags). In addition, the semantics of how the element is selected can be changed using `selectionMethod`. The value of this property can be one of:
    - a css id without `selectionMethod`
    - a css id or tag name with `selectionMethod="scope"`
    - a tag name with `selectionMethod="closest"`
  - `selectionMethod` This property can have one of two values: `scope` and
    `closest`. `scope` allows selection of element within the parent element of
    `amp-analytics` tag. `closest` searches for the closest ancestor of
    `amp-analytics` tag that satisfies the given selector.
  - `continuousTimeMin` and `continuousTimeMax` These properties indicate that a request should be fired when (any part of) an element has been within the viewport for a continuous amount of time that is between the minimum and maximum specified times. The times are expressed in milliseconds.
  - `totalTimeMin` and `totalTimeMax` These properties indicate that a request should be fired when (any part of) an element has been within the viewport for a total amount of time that is between the minimum and maximum specified times. The times are expressed in milliseconds.
  - `visiblePercentageMin` and `visiblePercentageMax` These properties indicate that a request should be fired when the proportion of an element that is visible within the viewport is between the minimum and maximum specified percentages. Percentage values between 0 and 100 are valid. Note that the lower bound (`visiblePercentageMin`) is inclusive while the upper bound (`visiblePercentageMax`) is not. When these properties are defined along with other timing related properties, only the time when these properties are met are counted.

In addition to the conditions above, `visibilitySpec` also enables certain variables which are documented [here](./analytics-vars.md#visibility-variables).

```javascript
"triggers": {
  "defaultPageview": {
    "on": "visible",
    "request": "pageview",
    "visibilitySpec": {
      "selector": "#anim-id",
      "visiblePercentageMin": 20,
      "totalTimeMin": 500,
      "continuousTimeMin": 200
    }
  }
}
```

In addition to the variables provided as part of triggers you can also specify additional / overrides for [variables as data attribute](./analytics-vars.md#variables-as-data-attribute). If used, these data attributes have to be part of element specified as the `selector`
#### Click trigger (`"on": "click"`)
Use this configuration to fire a request when a specified element is clicked. Use `selector` to control which elements will cause this request to fire:
  - `selector` A CSS selector used to refine which elements should be tracked. Use value `*` to track all elements. The value of `selector` can include variables that are defined in inline or remote config. The variables will be expanded to determine the elements to be tracked.

    ```javascript
    "vars": {
      "id1": "#socialButtonId",
      "id2": ".shareButtonClass"
    },
    "triggers": {
      "anchorClicks": {
        "on": "click",
        "selector": "a, ${id1}, ${id2}",
        "request": "event",
        "vars": {
          "eventId": 128
        }
      }
    }
    ```
In addition to the variables provided as part of triggers you can also specify additional / overrides for [variables as data attribute](./analytics-vars.md#variables-as-data-attribute). If used, these data attributes have to be part of element specified as the `selector`
#### Scroll trigger (`"on": "scroll"`)
Use this configuration to fire a request under certain conditions when the page is scrolled. This trigger provides [special vars](./analytics-vars.md#interaction) that indicate the boundaries that triggered a request to be sent. Use `scrollSpec` to control when this will fire:
  - `scrollSpec` This object can contain `verticalBoundaries` and `horizontalBoundaries`. At least one of the two properties is required for a scroll event to fire. The values for both of the properties should be arrays of numbers containing the boundaries on which a scroll event is generated. For instance, in the following code snippet, the scroll event will be fired when page is scrolled vertically by 25%, 50% and 90%. Additionally, the event will also fire when the page is horizontally scrolled to 90% of scroll width. To keep the page performant, the scroll boundaries are rounded to the nearest multiple of `5`.


    ```javascript
    "triggers": {
      "scrollPings": {
        "on": "scroll",
        "scrollSpec": {
          "verticalBoundaries": [25, 50, 90],
          "horizontalBoundaries": [90]
        },
        "request": "event"
      }
    }
    ```

#### Timer trigger (`"on": "timer"`)
Use this configuration to fire a request on a regular time interval. Use `timerSpec` to control when this will fire:
  - `timerSpec` Specification for triggers of type `timer`. The timer will trigger immediately (by default, can be unset) and then at a specified interval thereafter.
    - `interval` Length of the timer interval, in seconds.
    - `maxTimerLength` Maximum duration for which the timer will fire, in seconds.
    - `immediate` trigger timer immediately or not. Boolean, defaults to true

    ```javascript
    "triggers": {
      "pageTimer": {
        "on": "timer",
        "timerSpec": {
          "interval": 10,
          "maxTimerLength": 600
        },
        "request": "pagetime"
      }
    }
    ```

#### Hidden trigger (`"on": "hidden"`)
Use this configuration to fire a request when the page becomes is hidden.  The firing of this trigger can be configured using [`visibilitySpec`](#visibility-spec).

```javascript
"triggers": {
  "defaultPageview": {
    "on": "hidden",
    "request": "pagehide",
  }
}
```

#### Access triggers (`"on": "amp-access-*"`)

AMP Access system issues numerous events for different states in the access flow. See [amp-access-analytics.md](../amp-access/amp-access-analytics.md) for details.

### Transport
The `transport` attribute specifies how to send a request. The value is an object with fields that
indicate which transport methods are acceptable.

  - `beacon` Indicates [`navigator.sendBeacon`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator/sendBeacon)
     can be used to transmit the request. This will send a POST request, with credentials, and an empty body.
  - `xhrpost` Indicates `XMLHttpRequest` can be used to transmit the request. This will send a POST
     request, with credentials, and an empty body.
  - `image` Indicates the request can be sent by generating an `Image` tag. This will send a GET request.

If more than one of the above transport methods are enabled, the precedence is `beacon` > `xhrpost` > `image`. Only one transport method will be used, and it will be the highest precedence one that is permitted and available. If the client's user agent does not support a method, the next highest precedence method enabled will be used. By default, all three methods above are enabled.

In the example below, `beacon` and `xhrpost` are set to `false`, so they will not be used even though they have higher precedence than `image`. `image` would be set `true` by default, but it is explicitly declared here. If the client's user agent supports the `image` method, then it will be used; otherwise, no request would be sent.

```javascript
"transport": {
  "beacon": false,
  "xhrpost": false,
  "image": true
}
```


### Extra URL Params

The `extraUrlParams` attribute specifies additional parameters to append to the query string of a request URL via the usual "&foo=baz" convention.

Here's an example that would append `&a=1&b=2&c=3` to a request:

```javascript
"extraUrlParams": {
  "a": "1",
  "b": "2",
  "c": "3"
}
```

The `extraUrlParamsReplaceMap` attribute specifies a map of keys and values that act as parameters to String.replace() to preprocess keys in the extraUrlParams configuration. For example, if an `extraUrlParams` configuration defines `"page.title": "The title of my page"` and the `extraUrlParamsReplaceMap` defines `"page.": "_p_"`, then `&_p_title=The%20title%20of%20my%20page%20` will be appended to the request.

`extraUrlParamsReplaceMap` is not required to use `extraUrlParams`. If `extraUrlParamsReplaceMap` is not defined, then no string substitution will happens and the strings defined in `extraUrlParams` are used as-is.

## Validation

See [amp-analytics rules](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/blob/master/extensions/amp-analytics/0.1/validator-amp-analytics.protoascii) in the AMP validator specification.
