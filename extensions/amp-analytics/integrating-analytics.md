# Integrate your analytics tools in AMP HTML

## Overview

If you operate a software-as-a-service tool for publishers to better understand their traffic and visitors, you may want to integrate your service into `amp-analytics`. This will enable your customers to view traffic patterns for their AMP HTML pages.

## Before you begin

Before you can add your analytics service to AMP HTML runtime, you may need to:
* Identify the kinds of [variables](analytics-vars.md) and [requests](amp-analytics.md#requests) you'll need in an AMP HTML document for your analytics service.
* Identify the triggers that result in analytics requests being sent from a page that would be relevant for your service.
* Consider if and how you will [track users across](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/blob/master/spec/amp-managing-user-state.md) first-party and third-party AMP contexts.
* Determine how your analytics dashboard handles AMP traffic.
* Identify any missing functionality in `amp-analytics`, and [file requests](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/issues/new) for needed features.
* AMP Analytics sends its variables as query string parameters in a HTTPS request to a preconfigured endpoint.  If you do not already have an existing endpoint, review [this sample](https://github.com/ampproject/amp-publisher-sample#amp-analytics-sample) for an overview on how to build one.  
* Consider how integration with `amp-analytics` may impact any policies (particularly your privacy policy) or agreements you may have.

## Adding your configuration to the AMP HTML runtime

1. Create an [Intent-To-Implement issue](../../CONTRIBUTING.md#contributing-features) stating that you'll be adding your analytics service's configuration to AMP HTML's runtime.
1. Develop a patch that implements the following:
    1. A new block in [vendors.js](0.1/vendors.js) including any options above and beyond the default, such as:
        1. "vars": {} for additional default variables.
        1. "requests": {} for requests that your service will use.
        1. "optout": if needed.  We currently don't have a great opt-out system, so please reach out to help us design one that works well for you.
    1. An example in the [examples/analytics-vendors.amp.html](../../examples/analytics-vendors.amp.html)
    1. A line for your analytics service in the 'type' attribute section of the [amp-analytics](amp-analytics.md) usage reference.
1. Test the new example you put in [examples/analytics-vendors.amp.html](../../examples/analytics-vendors.amp.html) to ensure the hits from the example are working as expected. For example, the data needed is being collected and displayed in your analytics dashboard.
1. Submit a Pull Request with this patch, referencing the Intent-To-Implement issue.
1. Update your service's usage documentation and inform your customers.


## Tag Managers

Tag management services have two options for integrating with AMP Analytics:

* **Endpoint approach:** Acting as the an additional endpoint for `amp-analytics`, and conducting marketing management in the backend.
* **Config approach:** Conducting tag management via a dynamically generated JSON config file unique to each publisher.

The endpoint approach is the same as the standard approach detailed in the previous section.  The config approach consists of creating a unique configuration for amp-analytics that is specific to each publisher and includes all of their compatible analytics packages.  A publisher would include the configuration using a syntax similar to this: 

```html
  <amp-analytics config="https://my-awesome-tag-manager.example.com/user-id.json">
```

To take this approach, review the documentation for publishers' integration with AMP Analytics.
