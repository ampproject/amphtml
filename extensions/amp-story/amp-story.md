# amp-story

[Web stories](https://amp.dev/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/start/create_successful_stories/?format=stories) are an immersive, tappable and easily shareable storytelling format. Web stories are built using the AMP Framework. The `amp-story` component provides the AMP story subsect of AMP. It is the base technology for web stories.

## Version notes

| Version | Description                                                                             |
| ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1.0     | Current version, since 2018-07-16.                                                      |
| 0.1     | Initial implementation. This is no longer valid AMP, and will be deleted on 2019-10-01. |

### Migrating from 0.1 to 1.0

As of 2018-07-16, version 0.1 is considered deprecated, and will be deleted on 2019-10-01. This may cause minor breaking changes, as your stories will automatically be upgraded to use version 1.0. We recommend manually migrating your pages to version 1.0 before this date to ensure functionality and proper design.

## AMP story format

An [AMP story](#story:-amp-story) is a complete AMP HTML document that is comprised of [pages](#pages:-amp-story-page), within the pages are [layers](#layers:-amp-story-grid-layer), within the layers are AMP & HTML elements, like media, analytics, text, and so on.

### Boilerplate

The following markup is a decent starting point or boilerplate. Copy this and save it to a file with a `.html` extension.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html amp lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <script async src="https://cdn.ampproject.org/v0.js"></script>
    <script
      async
      custom-element="amp-story"
      src="https://cdn.ampproject.org/v0/amp-story-1.0.js"
    ></script>
    <title>Hello, amp-story</title>
    <link rel="canonical" href="http://example.ampproject.org/my-story.html" />
    <meta
      name="viewport"
      content="width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1"
    />
    <style amp-boilerplate>
      body {
        -webkit-animation: -amp-start 8s steps(1, end) 0s 1 normal both;
        -moz-animation: -amp-start 8s steps(1, end) 0s 1 normal both;
        -ms-animation: -amp-start 8s steps(1, end) 0s 1 normal both;
        animation: -amp-start 8s steps(1, end) 0s 1 normal both;
      }
      @-webkit-keyframes -amp-start {
        from {
          visibility: hidden;
        }
        to {

        }
      }
      @-moz-keyframes -amp-start {
        from {

        }
        to {

        }
      }
      @-ms-keyframes -amp-start {
        from {

        }
      }
      @-o-keyframes -amp-start {
        from {
          visibility: hidden;
        }
        to {
          visibility: visible;
        }
      }
      @keyframes -amp-start {
        from {
          visibility: hidden;
        }
        to {
          visibility: visible;

  <body>
    <amp-story
      standalone
      title="Hello Story"
      publisher="The AMP Team"
      publisher-logo-src="https://example.com/logo/1x1.png"
      poster-portrait-src="https://example.com/my-story/poster/3x4.jpg"
    >
      <amp-story-page id="my-first-page">

            width="900"
            height="1600"
          >
          </amp-img>
        </amp-story-grid-layer>
        <amp-story-grid-layer template="vertical">
          <h1>Hello, amp-story!</h1>
        </amp-story-grid-layer>
      </amp-story-page>
      <amp-story-page id="my-second-page">
        <amp-story-grid-layer template="fill">
          <amp-img
            src="https://example.ampproject.org/helloworld/bg2.gif"
            width="900"
            height="1600"
          >
          </amp-img>
        </amp-story-grid-layer>
        <amp-story-grid-layer template="vertical">
          <h1>The End</h1>
        </amp-story-grid-layer>
      </amp-story-page>
      <amp-story-bookend src="bookendv1.json" layout="nodisplay">
      </amp-story-bookend>
    </amp-story>
  </body>
</html>
```

The content in the body creates a story with two pages. Each page has a full bleed background image, with a simple string of text on top of it.

### Required markup for amp-story

The AMP story HTML format follows the [same markup requirements as a valid AMP HTML document](https://amp.dev/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/learn/spec/amphtml#required-markup), along with the following additional requirements:

| RULE                                                                                                                                                            | DESCRIPTION                                                                           |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| The `<amp-story standalone>` element is the only child element of `<body>`.                                                                                     | Identifies that the document is an AMP story.                                         |
| Contain a `<script async src="https://cdn.ampproject.org/v0/amp-story-1.0.js" custom-element="amp-story"></script>` tag as the third child of the `<head>` tag. | Includes and loads the amp-story JS library.                                          |
| Contain a `<link rel="canonical" href="$STORY_URL">` tag inside the `<head>`.                                                                                   | The link points to the story itself, identifying the story as the canonical document. |

## Story: `amp-story`

The `amp-story` component represents an entire story. The component itself implements the UI shell, including handling gestures and navigation, and inserting the application shell UI (controls, progress bar, etc).

  title="My Story"
  publisher="The AMP Team"
  publisher-logo-src="https://example.com/logo/1x1.png"

  background-audio="my.mp3"
>
  <amp-story-page>[...]</amp-story-page>
  <amp-story-page>[...]</amp-story-page>
  <amp-story-page>[...]</amp-story-page>
  <amp-story-bookend src="./related.json"></amp-story-bookend>
</amp-story>
```

### Metadata guidelines

Metadata attributes display a preview of the story across the Web Stories ecosystem, such as rendering an engaging preview link in the bookend of a related stories. These attributes future-proof your story for rich, embedded experience Web Stories surfaces to come.

These metadata attributes supplement and do not replace any Structured Data (e.g. JSON-LD) on the page. We still recommend adding [Structured Data to your Web Stories](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/guides/enable-web-stories#implement).

#### `publisher-logo-src` guidelines

These guidelines apply to the publisher logo image:

- Provide a raster file, such as `.jpg`, `.png`, or `.gif`. Avoid vector files, such as `.svg` or `.eps`.
- Avoid animated images, such as animated gifs.
- Image logo should be legible on the background color.

    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

- Logos should be at least 96x96 pixels and a perfect square.
- The background should not be transparent.
- Use one logo per brand that is consistent across AMP stories.

#### Poster guidelines (for `poster-portrait-src`, `poster-landscape-src`, and `poster-square-src`)

These guidelines apply to the story poster image(s):

- The poster image should be representative of the entire AMP story.
- The poster image should be visible to the user when the AMP story begins. To accommodate sizing, cropping or minor styling changes or preview purposes, the image file URL used in the metadata does not need to be an exact match to the URL on the first page of the story.
- Provide a raster file, such as `.jpg`, `.png`, or `.gif`. Avoid vector files, such as `.svg` or `.eps`.
- The poster image should be in 3x4 aspect ratio for portrait, 4x3 for landscape, and 1x1 for square.
- If the poster image is derived from a frame in a video, the thumbnail should be representative of the video. For example, the first frame in a video is often not representative.
- Each poster image should meet the recommended minimium size:
  - Portrait: 640px x 853px
  - Landscape: 853px x 640px
  - Square: 640px x 640px

### Landscape orientation and full bleed desktop experience opt in

If the `supports-landscape` attribute is specified on the `<amp-story>` element, it will:

- Allow the story to be seen when a mobile device is held in a landscape orientation.
- Change the desktop experience to an immersive full bleed mode, replacing the default three portrait panels experience.

Usage: `<amp-story ... supports-landscape>...</amp-story>`

### Live story

<figure class="centered-fig">
  <amp-anim alt="Live story example" width="300" height="533" layout="fixed" src="https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/raw/master/extensions/amp-story/img/live-stories-gif.gif">

  </amp-anim>
</figure>

Use the `live-story` attribute to append new pages to a story for users to see in real-time.

This attribute shows a notification of new pages to users on the last page, and updates the progress bar.

Core use cases for live-story include coverage for breaking news or live events, enabling real-time updates to users without exiting the story. Award shows, sporting events, and elections are some examples.

#### How it works

In the background, while an AMP Story using `live-story` is displayed on the client, the AMP runtime polls the origin document on the host for updates. When the client receives a response, it then filters and dynamically inserts those updates back into the story on the client. Publishers can customize the polling rate in order to control the number of incoming requests, and AMP caches like the Google AMP Cache can perform optimizations to reduce the server response payload, saving client bandwidth and CPU cycles.

#### Polling

In most implementations for live blogs, content is either pushed by the server to the client instance of a page, or the client polls a JSON endpoint to receive updates. The implementation here is different, in that the client instance of the story polls the server copy of the story document for updates inside the `<amp-story>` element. For instance: if the user is viewing a story served from an AMP cache, the client will poll that document hosted on that AMP cache for updates; if the user is viewing a document served from a web publisher's origin domain (e.g. "example.com"), then the client will poll the document hosted on that origin domain for updates.

This means that publishers of stories do not need to set up a JSON endpoint or push mechanism for this functionality to work.

Content is updated by publishing to the same URL with valid `<amp-story>` markup. The content is pulled into the user's client instance during the next poll. Poll intervals are configurable using the [`data-poll-interval`](#data-poll-interval) attribute.

#### Stop polling

As long as the `live-story` attribute is present on the `<amp-story>` element, the client will make continuous polls to the server copy of the document. Make sure to set the `live-story-disabled` attribute to the `<amp-story>` element when you publish your last update to the story. This will make the polling stop.

#### Usage

- Specify an `id` on the `<amp-story>` element.
- Add the `live-story` attribute to the `<amp-story>` element.
- [Optional] Add the [`data-poll-interval`](#data-poll-interval) attribute to the `<amp-story>` element to specify a time interval for checking for new updates.
- [Optional] When finishing the live broadcast, add the [`live-story-disabled`](#live-story-disabled) attribute to the `<amp-story>` element to disable the polling.
- On each `<amp-story-page>`:
  - Specify a `data-sort-time` attribute with a valid value. This is a timestamp used for sorting the pages. Higher timestamps will be inserted after older page entries. We recommend using [Unix time](https://www.unixtimestamp.com/).

```html
<amp-story id="story1" live-story ...>
  <amp-story-page id="cover" data-sort-time="1552330790"> ... </amp-story-page>
  <amp-story-page id="page1" data-sort-time="1552330791"> ... </amp-story-page>
  <amp-story-page id="page2" data-sort-time="1552330792"> ... </amp-story-page>
</amp-story>
```

### Children (of amp-story)

The `<amp-story>` component contains one or more [`<amp-story-page>`](#pages:-amp-story-page) components, containing each of the individual screens of the story. The first page specified in the document order is the first page shown in the story.

#### Optional customization

##### Crop `amp-img` and `amp-video` assets using `object-position`

The `object-position` attribute can be used on `<amp-img>` and `<amp-video>` elements to specify the alignment of the asset within its container (crop).
By default these assets are centered and, depending on the viewport ratio, have their edges are cropped out of the container. Because the zone of interest of an asset is not always its center, the `object-position` allows specifying what part of the image has to remain visible.
This attribute accepts any value accepted by the `object-position` CSS property.

Example:

<amp-img alt="Custom crop on amp-img and amp-video assets" layout="fixed" src="https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/blob/master/extensions/amp-story/img/amp-story-object-position.gif" width="600" height="689">
  <noscript>
    <img alt="Custom crop on amp-img and amp-video assets" src="https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/blob/master/extensions/amp-story/img/amp-story-object-position.gif" />
  </noscript>
</amp-img>

This same image can be used for both mobile portrait and landscape desktop using the `object-position` this way:

```html
<amp-img src="cat.jpg" object-position="75% 40%"></amp-img>
```

##### `data-text-background-color`

The `data-text-background-color` attribute highlights the text of the element with a specified color. To highlight the entire block, add this attribute directly to the text element. To only highlight the text, add the attribute and text to an inner <span>. Note that works anywhere inside an `<amp-story-page>`, not just in `<amp-story-grid-layer>`.

Example:
<amp-img alt="text background color only example" layout="fixed" src="https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/blob/master/extensions/amp-story/img/text-background-color-ex-1.png" width="145" height="255">
<noscript>
<img alt="text background color only example" src="https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/blob/master/extensions/amp-story/img/text-background-color-ex-1.png" />
</noscript>
</amp-img>

```html
<amp-story-grid-layer template="vertical">
  <h2>
    <span data-text-background-color="crimson">
      Cat ipsum dolor sit amet, sleeps on my head, but lounge in doorway so if
      human is on laptop sit on the keyboard
    </span>
  </h2>
</amp-story-grid-layer>
```

Example:
<amp-img alt="text background color full example" layout="fixed" src="https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/blob/master/extensions/amp-story/img/text-background-color-ex-2.png" width="145" height="255">
<noscript>
<img alt="text background color full example" src="https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/blob/master/extensions/amp-story/img/text-background-color-ex-2.png" />
</noscript>
</amp-img>

```html
<amp-story-grid-layer template="vertical">
  <h2 data-text-background-color="crimson">
    Cat ipsum dolor sit amet, sleeps on my head, but lounge in doorway so if
    human is on laptop sit on the keyboard
  </h2>
</amp-story-grid-layer>
```

#### Interactive components

We support embedding components such as `<amp-twitter>` inside `amp-story-grid-layer`. By default they are not interactive in the story (i.e. tapping on them will not have any effect), but by using the `interactive` attribute, you can make them be fully interactive.

When clicked, the component will be shown in a lightbox-like mode. Here, a user can choose to further interact with the embed, or close the lightbox and go back to the story.

Example:

<figure class="centered-fig">
  <span class="special-char">Example:</span>
  <amp-anim alt="Embedded component example" layout="flex-item" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ampproject/amphtml/master/extensions/amp-story/img/amp-story-tooltip.gif" width="300" height="553">
  <noscript><img width="300" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ampproject/amphtml/master/extensions/amp-story/img/amp-story-tooltip.gif" /></noscript>
  </amp-anim>
</figure>

```html
<amp-twitter
  width="100"
  height="100"
  layout="responsive"
  data-tweetid="1102562523524579328"
  interactive
>
</amp-twitter>
```

#### Links in amp-story-grid-layer

We support inline links `<a>` as a descendant of `amp-story-grid-layer`. Whenever a link is tapped a tooltip will be shown - deferring the corresponding action until the user taps again in the tooltip.

#### Customizing tooltip for links or interactive components

You can customize the contents of the tooltip displayed on top of a user interactive element by specifying the following attributes. If they are not specified, a fallback value will be provided automatically.

##### `data-tooltip-icon`

Takes in a `src` where the icon image is located.

##### `data-tooltip-text`

A string that will be shown when the tooltip appears.

Example:

```html
<a
  href="https://www.google.com"
  role="link"
  data-tooltip-icon="./assets/ic_amp_googblue_1x_web_24dp.png"
  data-tooltip-text="Go to page"
>
  Click me!
</a>
```

#### Integration with sidebar for stories

`amp-story` supports the use of `amp-sidebar` with a few limitations and caveats. See the [Sidebar for Stories documentation](https://amp.dev/documentation/components/amp-sidebar?format=websites#sidebar-for-stories) for more details.

By using branching and `amp-sidebar`, you can create stories that have a table of contents. To do this, make use of URL fragment parameter.

The following example demonstrates a table of contents inside of an `amp-sidebar`. The table of contents has a link to a specific story page, and and out-link to a different website.

```html
<amp-story id="story" standalone>
  <amp-sidebar id="sidebar1" layout="nodisplay">
    <ul>
      <li><a href="#page=bacon-page"> Bacon page </a></li>
      <li><a href="https://www.amp.dev"> External Link </a></li>
    </ul>
  </amp-sidebar>

  <amp-story-page id="bacon-page">
    <amp-story-grid-layer>
      <p>Bacon, of course!</p>
    </amp-story-grid-layer>
  </amp-story-page>
  ...
</amp-story>
```

#### Other components usable in AMP stories

## Animations

Every element inside an `<amp-story-page>` can have an entrance animation.

You can configure animations by specifying a set of [animation attributes](#animation-attributes) on the element; no additional AMP extensions or configuration is needed.

### Animation effects

The following animation effects are available as presets for AMP stories:

| Preset name       | Default duration (ms) | Default delay (ms) |
| ----------------- | --------------------- | ------------------ |
| `drop`            | 1600                  | 0                  |

{% endcall %}

### Animation attributes

#### animate-in [required]

Use this attribute to specify the name of the entrance [animation preset](#animation-effects).

_Example_: A heading flies in from left of the page.

```html
<h2 animate-in="fly-in-left">
  Fly from left!
</h2>
```

#### animate-in-duration [optional]

Use this attribute to specify the duration of the entrance animation, in seconds or milliseconds (e.g., 0.2s or 200ms). The default duration depends on the animation preset you specified.

_Example_: A heading flies in from left of the page and the animation finishes within half a second.

```html
<h2 animate-in="fly-in-left" animate-in-duration="0.5s">
  Fly from left!
</h2>
```

#### animate-in-timing-function [optional]

Use this attribute to specify the timing function (animation curve) of the entrance animation. The default timing function depends on the animation preset you specified.

_Example_: A heading flies in from left of the page and the animation decelerates (ease-out).

```html
<h2
  animate-in="fly-in-left"
  animate-in-timing-function="cubic-bezier(0.0, 0.0, 0.2, 1)"
>
  Fly from left!
</h2>
```

#### animate-in-delay [optional]

Use this attribute to specify the delay before starting the animation. The value must be greater than or equal to 0, in seconds or milliseconds (for example, 0.2s or 200ms). The default delay depends on the animation preset you specified.

_Example_: After 0.4 seconds, a heading flies in from the left of the page and completes its entrance within 0.5 seconds.

```html
<h2 animate-in="fly-in-left" animate-in-duration="0.5s" animate-in-delay="0.4s">
  Fly from left!
</h2>
```

{% call callout('Note', type='note') %}
The animation delay is not guaranteed to be exact. Additional delays can be caused by loading the `amp-animation` extension in the background when the first animated element has been scanned. The attribute contract is defined as _delay this animation for at least N milliseconds_. This applies to all elements including those with a delay of 0 seconds.
{% endcall %}

#### animate-in-after [optional]

Use this attribute to chain or sequence animations (for example, animation2 starts after animation1 is complete). Specify the ID of the animated element that this element's animation will follow. The element must be present on the same `<amp-story-page>`. The delay is applied after the previous element's animation has finished. For further details, see the [Sequencing animations](#sequencing-animations) section below.

For example, in the following code, `object2` animates in after `object1` completes their entrance:

```html
<amp-story-page id="page1">
  <amp-story-grid-layer template="vertical">
    <div id="object1" animate-in="rotate-in-left">
      1
    </div>
    <div id="object2" animate-in="fly-in-right" animate-in-after="object1">
      2
      <!-- will start after object1 has finished -->
    </div>
  </amp-story-grid-layer>
</amp-story-page>
```

#### scale-start, scale-end [optional, only works with `zoom-in` & `zoom-out` animations]

Use these two attributes to further specify the parameters of your zoom-in and zoom-out animations. The value must be greater than or equal to 0, and decimals are allowed. The default will be scale-start: 1 and scale-start: 3 for zoom-in, and the inverse for zoom-out.

_Example_: An image zooming-in from 2x to 5x its size over 4 seconds.

```html
<amp-img
  animate-in="zoom-in"
  scale-start="2"
  scale-end="5"
  animate-in-duration="4s"
  layout="fixed"
  src="https://picsum.photos/720/320?image=1026"
  width="720"
  height="320"
>
</amp-img>
```

#### translate-x [optional, only works with `pan-left` & `pan-right` animations]

Use this attribute to specify the horizontal panning of your image in a pan-left/pan-right animation. The value must be greater than or equal to 0 in pixels. The default value will pan the whole width of the specified image.

_Example_: An image panning 200px to the left over 10 seconds.

```html
<amp-img
  animate-in="pan-left"
  translate-x="200px"
  animate-in-duration="10s"
  layout="fixed"
  src="https://picsum.photos/720/320?image=1026"
  width="720"
  height="320"
>
</amp-img>
```

#### translate-y [optional, only works with `pan-up` & `pan-down` animations]

Use this attribute to specify the vertical panning of your image in a pan-up/pan-down animation. The value must be greater than or equal to 0 in pixels. The default value will pan the whole height of the specified image.

_Example_: An image panning 50px down over 15 seconds.

```html
<amp-img
  animate-in="pan-down"
  translate-y="50px"
  animate-in-duration="15s"
  layout="fixed"
  src="https://picsum.photos/720/320?image=1026"
  width="720"
  height="320"
>
</amp-img>
```

### Sequencing animations

To chain animations in sequence, use the `animate-in-after` attribute. All elements in a given chain must be present in the same `<amp-story-page>`. Elements without the `animate-in-after` attribute do not belong to a sequence chain, and will start independently on page entrance.

```html
<amp-story-page id="my-sequencing-page">
  <amp-story-grid-layer template="vertical">
    <div class="circle" animate-in="drop-in" animate-in-duration="1.8s">
      1
      <!-- will start independently -->
    </div>
    <div
      id="rotate-in-left-obj"
      class="square"
      animate-in="rotate-in-left"
      animate-in-after="fade-in-obj"
      animate-in-delay="0.2s"
    >
      2
      <!-- will start after fade-in-obj has finished -->
    </div>
    <div
      class="square"
      animate-in-after="rotate-in-left-obj"
      animate-in="whoosh-in-right"
      animate-in-delay="0.2s"
    >
      3
      <!-- will start after rotate-in-left-obj has finished -->
    </div>
    <div
      id="fade-in-obj"
      class="circle"
      animate-in="fade-in"
      animate-in-duration="2.2s"
    >
      1
      <!-- will start independently -->
    </div>
  </amp-story-grid-layer>
</amp-story-page>
```

### Combining multiple animations

You can apply multiple entrance animations on one element (for example, an element flies into the page and fades in at the same time). It's not possible to assign more than one animation preset to a single element; however, elements with different entrance animations can be nested to combine them into one.

```html
<div animate-in="fly-in-left">
  <div animate-in="fade-in">
    I will fly-in and fade-in!
  </div>
</div>
```

{% call callout('Note', type='note') %}
If a composed animation is supposed to start after the end of a separate element's animation, make sure that all nested elements that compose the animation have the attribute `animate-in-after` set to the same `id`.
{% endcall %}

## Branching

Branching enables the identification of individual story pages. Users can jump around within a story, start a story from somewhere other than the beginning, and share specific story pages. An example is a table of contents or multiple choice buttons.

Fragment parameters in the URL supports this feature.

Branching allows navigation manipulation within a story. The story tracks navigation. If a user navigates from `page-1` to `page-5` and then `page-6`, navigating backwards will follow the exact path. The skipped pages are not exposed to the user when navigating backwards, it will follow `page-6`, to `page-5`, and ends back at `page-1`.

### URL Fragment Parameter

With branching, AMP Stories now supports URLs in the form of:

```
https://www.mydomain.com/good-story/#page=<page-id>
```

where `page-id` refers to the unique id of an `amp-story-page`. You can also use the fragment parameter and the `page-id` value like an anchor link in some use cases. See [Integration with Sidebar for Stories](#integration-with-sidebar-for-stories) for an example.

## Localization

To localize your story, include the language code in the `lang` attribute on the `<html>` tag of your story, such as `<html ⚡ lang="en">` for English. The supported language codes are:

- ar (Arabic)
- de (German)
- en-GB (English, UK)
- en (English, US)
- es-419 (Spanish, Central/Latin America)
- es (Spanish, Spain)
- fr-CA (French, Canada)
- fr (French, France)
- hi (Hindi)
- id (Indonesian)
- it (Italian)
- ja (Japanese)
- ko (Korean)
- nl (Dutch)
- no (Norwegian)
- pt-BR (Portuguese, Brazil)
- pt (Portuguese, Portugal)
- ru (Russian)
- tr (Turkish)
- vi (Vietnamese)
- zh-TW (Traditional Chinese)
- zh (Simplified Chinese)

Additionally, for right-to-left languages, you may include the `dir="rtl"` attribute on the `<html>` tag of your story. This may be used in conjunction with the language code as well, e.g. `<html ⚡ lang="ar" dir="rtl">`.
