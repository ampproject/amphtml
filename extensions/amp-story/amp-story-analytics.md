# <a name="amp-story-analytics"></a>AMP Story and Analytics

## Story triggers

`amp-story` issues events for changes of state. These events can be reported through the analytics configuration by using triggers.

See [amp-analytics.md](../amp-analytics/amp-analytics.md) for details on *amp-analytics* configuration.

### Visible trigger (`"on": "story-page-visible"`)

The `story-page-visible` event is issued when a story page becomes visible.

```javascript
"triggers": {
  "storyPageVisible": {
    "on": "story-page-visible",
    "request": "event"
  }
}
```

Because of the user experience of AMP story enables a user to traverse several "pages" without loading new HTML pages each time, one interesting consideration involving the `story-page-visible` event is how to record pageview events. One approach would be to count each `story-page-visible` event as a typical pageview (i.e. as if a user were visiting a new HTML page); another approach is to capture `story-page-visible` events specially as their own type of event.

Using `amp-analytics` you can re-assign the `story-page-visible` event to behave like a pageview event, which is a common vendor-specified event type:

```javascript
"triggers": {
  "storyPageVisible": {
    "on": "story-page-visible",
    "request": "pageview"
  }
}
```

Consult your vendor's documentation for more specific details on how to set this up.

### Bookend enter trigger (`"on": "story-bookend-enter"`)

The `story-bookend-enter` trigger is fired when the bookend is shown to the user, after the last page of the current story.

### Bookend exit trigger (`"on": "story-bookend-exit"`)

The `story-bookend-exit` trigger is fired when the bookend is dismissed by the user.

### Mute trigger (`"on": "story-audio-muted"`)

The `story-audio-muted` trigger is fired when the user initiates an interaction to mute the audio for the current story.

### Unmute trigger (`"on": "story-audio-unmuted"`)

The `story-audio-unmuted` trigger is fired when the user initiates an interaction to unmute the audio for the current story.

## Story variables

AMP story contributes the following URL substitutions:

### `storyPageId`

The unique ID for an AMP story page, as provided by the `id` attribute of the current `amp-story-page`.

### `storyPageIndex`

A zero-based index value for an AMP story page determined by its ordering within `amp-story`.

### `storyPageCount`

The total number of pages available to the user in the story.

### `storyProgress`

The user's progress through the story, as a decimal in the range [0...1].  This represents how many pages the user has passed; for example, if the user is currently looking at the second page of ten, the progress will be reported as 0.1 (as the user has not yet finished the second page).

### `storyIsMuted`

A boolean representing whether the story was muted when the accompanying trigger was fired.

### Additional Vars

Description of additional variables can be found in the [analytics-vars.md](../amp-analytics/analytics-vars.md) file.
