## Behavior

Each of the `amp-accordion` componentâ€™s immediate children is considered a section in the accordion. Each of these nodes must be a `<section>` tag.

- An `amp-accordion` can contain one or more `<section>`s as its direct children.
- Each `<section>` must contain exactly two direct children.
- The first child (of the section) must be one of `h1`, `h2`, ..., `h6`, `header`, and is the heading of the section.
- The second child (of the section) can be any tag allowed in AMP HTML and is the content of the section.
- Clicking/tapping on the heading of a section expands/ or collapses the section.

Example:

```html
<amp-accordion>
  <section expanded>
    <h2>Section 1</h2>
    <p>Bunch of awesome content</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Section 2</h2>
    <div>Bunch of awesome content</div>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Section 3</h2>
    <amp-img src="/awesome.png" width="300" height="300"></amp-img>
  </section>
</amp-accordion>
```

## Attributes

**expanded**

The `expanded` attribute can be set on any `<section>` that needs to be expanded on page load.

## Styling

- You may use the `amp-accordion` element selector to style it freely.
- `amp-accordion` elements are always `display: block`.
- `<section>` and the heading and content element are not float-able.
- `<section>`s will have an `expanded` attribute when they are expanded.
- The content element is clear-fixed with `overflow: hidden` and hence cannot have scrollbars.
- margins of the `amp-accordion`, `<section>` and the heading and content elements are set to 0 and can be overridden in custom styles.
- Both the header and content elements are `position: relative`.

## Validation

See [amp-accordion rules](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/blob/master/extensions/amp-accordion/0.1/validator-amp-accordion.protoascii) in the AMP validator specification.
