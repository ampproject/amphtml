# amp-accordion

Provides a way for viewers to glance at the content outline and jump to any section. This is helpful for mobile devices where even a couple of sentences into a section requires scrolling.

[TOC]

## Behavior

The `amp-accordion` component allows you to display collapsible and expandable content sections. Each of the `amp-accordion` componentâ€™s immediate children is considered a section in the accordion. Each of these nodes must be a `<section>` tag.

- An `amp-accordion` can contain one or more `<section>` elements as its direct children.
- Each `<section>` must contain exactly two direct children.
- The first child (of the section) represents the heading for the section and must be a heading element (one of `h1`, `h2`, ..., `h6`, `header`).
- The second child (of the section) can be any tag allowed in AMP HTML and represents the content of the section.
- Clicking/tapping on the heading of a section expands or collapses the section.
- The collapsed/expanded state of each section in the `amp-accordion` element will be preserved for the session level. To opt out of preserving this state, add the `disable-session-states` attribute to the `amp-accordion` element.

#### Example: Displaying an accordion

In this example, we display three sections, where the third section is expanded on page load. Also, we opted out of preserving the collapsed/expanded state by setting `disable-session-states`.

[example preview="inline" playground="true" imports="amp-accordion"]

```html
<amp-accordion{% if not format=='email'%} disable-session-states{% endif %}>
  <section>
    <h2>Section 1</h2>
    <p>Content in section 1.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Section 2</h2>
    <div>Content in section 2.</div>
  </section>
  <section expanded>
    <h2>Section 3</h2>
    <amp-img src="{{server_for_email}}/static/inline-examples/images/squirrel.jpg"
      width="320"
      height="256"></amp-img>
  </section>
</amp-accordion>
```

### Events

The events below will be triggered on `section`s of `accordion`.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="40%"><strong><code>expand</code></strong></td>
    <td>This event is triggered on the target <code>section</code> that changes from collapsed state to expanded state. Notice that calling <code>expand</code> on an already expanded <code>section</code> would not trigger this event.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="40%"><strong><code>collapse</code></strong></td>
    <td>This event is triggered on the target <code>section</code> that changes from expanded state to collapsed state. Notice that calling <code>collapse</code> on an already collapsed <code>section</code> would not trigger this event.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

### Actions

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="40%"><strong><code>toggle</code></strong></td>
    <td>This action toggles between the <code>expanded</code> and <code>collapsed</code> states of the <code>amp-accordion</code>. When called with no arguments, it will toggle all sections of the accordion. A single section may be specified with the <code>section</code> argument and the corresponding <code>id</code> as the value.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="40%"><strong><code>expand</code></strong></td>
    <td>This action expands an <code>amp-accordion</code>. If it is already <code>expanded</code>, it will stay so. When called with no arguments, it will expand all sections of the accordion. A single section may be specified with the <code>section</code> argument and the corresponding <code>id</code> as the value.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="40%"><strong><code>collapse</code></strong></td>
    <td>This action collapses an <code>amp-accordion</code>. If it is already collapsed, it will stay so. When called with no arguments, it will collapse all sections of the accordion. A single section may be specified with the <code>section</code> argument and the corresponding <code>id</code> as the value.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

#### Attributes

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="40%"><strong><code>animate</code></strong></td>
    <td>Set this attribute on the <code>&lt;amp-accordion&gt;</code> to animate the expansion / collapse of all accordion sections.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="40%"><strong><code>disable-session-states</code></strong></td>
    <td>Set this attribute on the <code>&lt;amp-accordion&gt;</code> to opt out of preserving the collapsed/expanded state of the accordion.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="40%"><strong><code>expanded</code></strong></td>
    <td>Set this attribute on a <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> to display the section as expanded on page load.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="40%"><strong><code>expand-single-section</code></strong></td>
    <td>Set this attribute on the <code>&lt;amp-accordion&gt;</code> to only allow one <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> to be expanded at a time. If the user focuses on one <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> any other previously expanded <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> will be collapsed.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="40%"><strong><code>[data-expand]</code></strong></td>
    <td>Bind this attribute on a <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> to expand or collapse the section. An expression that evaluates to <code>false</code> will collapse the section if it is expanded, and anything else will expand the section if it is collapsed.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

## Styling

- You may use the `amp-accordion` element selector to style it freely.
- `amp-accordion` elements are always `display: block`.
- The `<section>`, heading, and content elements cannot be float-able.
- When the section is expanded, the `<section>` element has an `expanded` attribute.
- The content element is clear-fixed with `overflow: hidden` and hence cannot have scrollbars.
- Margins of the `<amp-accordion>`, `<section>`, heading, and content elements are set to 0 and can be overridden in custom styles.
- Both the header and content elements are `position: relative`.

## Validation

See [amp-accordion rules](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/blob/master/extensions/amp-accordion/validator-amp-accordion.protoascii) in the AMP validator specification.
