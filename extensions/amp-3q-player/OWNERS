 * @fileoverview
 * AMPHTML uses a custom owners bot to enforce ownership rules across its
 * codebase to ensure that all incoming pull requests are reviewed by the right
 * people. This file is an example of the supported format.
 * OWNERS files support JSON5 syntax (see json5.org), a more human-readable and
 * writable variant of JSON which supports comments, unquoted obeject keys,
 * single quotes, and trailing commas. In this file, "this directory" refers to
 * the directory containing the OWNERS file.
 *
 * Example OWNERS file definition for a directory owned by the team
 * `ampproject/wg-components` and `rcebulko`, who should always be notified of
 * changes:
 *

// All owners files must contain a single `rules` key containing a list of
// owners rules.
  rules: [
    {
      owners: [
        { name: "ayvar2000" },
        { name: "ampproject/wg-cool-team" },

        { name: "dvoytenko", requestReviews: false },
        { name: "rcebulko", notify: false },
      ]
    },
    {
      pattern: "package.json",
      owners: [{ name: "packager" }],
    },
  ],
}
