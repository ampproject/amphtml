## Overview


Digidip allows you to monetise your content through affiliate marketing. It gives you instant access to over 40,000 merchant affiliate programs without the hassle of network sign ups, approvals or creating affiliate links.

In order to allow our publishers to track traffic, and at the same time profit from the power of amp pages, we developed a link-rewrite generic component. `amp-digidip` allows digidip publishers to automatically turn their normal merchant links into monetizable links and access analytics on how their data is performing. As a generic extension for url rewriting, it covers a wide range of needs, that makes it also useful for other type of users.

## Getting started


**Add the required script**
Inside the `<head>...</head>` section of your AMP page, insert this code before the line `<script async src="https://cdn.ampproject.org/v0.js"></script>`

Code:
```html
    <script async custom-element="amp-digidip" src="https://cdn.ampproject.org/v0/amp-digidip-0.1.js"></script>
```

**Add the amp-digidip extension**
Inside the `<body>...</body>` section of your AMP page, insert this code:

Code:
```html
    <amp-digidip
        layout="nodisplay">

        <script type="application/json">
                {
                    "output": "https://visit.digidip.net?pid=110&url=${href}&cid=${data.customerId}",
                    "section": [
                        "#product-listing-1",
                        "#product-listing-2",
                    ],
                    "attribute": {
                        "href": "((?!(https:\/\/youtube\.com)|(https:\/\/mobile\.vodafone\.de)).)*",
                        "id": "comments",
                        "class": "sidebar",
                        "rel": "(?!(skip))*",
                    },
                    "vars": {
                        "customerId": "12345"
                    }
                }
         </script>

    </amp-digidip>
```


The final code should look like:

```html
<!doctype html>
<html âš¡>
<head>
  ...
  <script async custom-element="amp-digidip" src="https://cdn.ampproject.org/v0/amp-digidip-0.1.js"></script>
  ...
  <script async src="https://cdn.ampproject.org/v0.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
    ...
    <amp-digidip
        layout="nodisplay">

        <script type="application/json">
                {
                    "output": "https://visit.digidip.net?pid=110&url=${href}&cid=${data.customerId}",
                    "section": [
                        "#product-listing-1",
                        "#product-listing-2",
                    ],
                    "attribute": {
                        "href": "((?!(https:\/\/youtube\.com)|(https:\/\/mobile\.vodafone\.de)).)*",
                        "id": "comments",
                        "class": "sidebar",
                        "rel": "(?!(skip))*",
                    },
                    "vars": {
                        "customerId": "12345"
                    }
                }
         </script>

    </amp-digidip>
    ....
</body>
</html>
```

## JSON configuration

##### output (required)

The "output" property is the redirection url plus a query string of placeholders that will be shifted with values defined in the config JSON 'vars' property, or in the anchor itself as a data attribute.

Example:
```html
    <amp-digidip
        layout="nodisplay">

        <script type="application/json">
                {
                    "output": "https://visit.digidip.net?pid=110&cid=${data.customerId}",
                    "vars": {
                        "customerId": "12345"
                    }
                }
         </script>

    </amp-digidip>
```

We can also define data values in the anchor data attribute as the following example:
```html
    <a href="http://amazon.de/644556" data-vars-event-id="231">
```

The config could be something like:

```json
    {
      "output": "https://visit.digidip.net?eid=${data.eventId}&cid=${data.customerId}"

    }
```
The resulting, rewritten URL would be:
```url
https://visit.digidip.net?eid=231&cid=12345
```

Besides defined placeholders that match the data defined in the 'vars' property of the JSON configuration, or as a data attribute, there are other pre-defined placeholders that will be shifted with information such as anchor url, page location, referrer page, or anchor id. The following table shows the relationship between defined data and placeholders.

| value          | source     |       example                                         |    placeholder       
| -------------- | ---------- |-------------------------------------------------------|----------------------
| location       | page       |    `https://www.pepper.com/`                          |  `${location}`        
| referrer       | page       |    `https://google.de/`                               |  `${referrer}`        
| rev            | anchor     |    `<a href="..." rev="author" />`                    |  `${rev}`             
| id             | anchor     |    `<a href="..." id="link" />`                       |  `${id}`              
| rev            | anchor     |    `<a href="..." rel="pass" />`                      |  `${rel}`             
| href           | anchor     |    `<a href="https://amazon.com" />`                  |  `${href}`            
| rev            | anchor     |    `<a href="..." rev="author" />`                    |  `${rev}`             
| data-vars-*    | anchor     |    `<a href="..." data-vars-merchant-id="123" />`     |  `${data.merchantId}`
| vars.*         | config     |    `{ "vars": { "publisherId": "123" } }`             |  `${data.publisherId}`


##### section (optional)

The "section" property defines an array of css selector expressions that filter areas where the url rewriting should operate.

Example:
```json
     {
        "output": "https://visit.digidip.net?pid=110&url=${href}&cid=${customerId}",
        "section": [
            "#product-listing-1",
            "#product-listing-2",
        ]
    }
```

In the previous example, the html sections defined with attribute ID equal to "product-listing-1" and "product-listing-2" will be considered for url rewriting.

##### attribute (optional)

The "attribute" property defines a list of rules to match the anchor elements retrieved from the filtered sections. These rules are built from regular expressions associated with html element attributes as "id", "href", "class" or "rel".

Example:

```json
     {
      "section": [
                 "#product-listing-1"
             ],
      "attribute": {
                        "href": "((?!(https:\/\/youtube\.com)|(https:\/\/mobile\.vodafone\.de)).)*",
                        "class": "comments"
                   }
    }
```

The anchors within the html area with id 'product-listing-1' will have to match the regex expression defined for the attribute href and id.
In this example, it means that all the anchors with 'youtube.com' and 'mobile.vodafone.de' will be excluded. Also, the included anchors need to have a class attribute with the value 'comments'
