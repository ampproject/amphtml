# This is a configuration file for a Lando-based local dev environment for amphtml.
# It is an alternative to the existing local development environment to what is described in the Getting Started
# End-to-end guide <https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/blob/master/contributing/getting-started-e2e.md>.
#
# This environment allows you to encapsulate the amphtml development environment inside of a Docker container.
# Instead of accessing <http://localhost:8000>, this environment can be accessed via <https://amphtml.lando.site>.
#
# Getting started:
# 1. Install the latest release of Lando per <https://docs.lando.dev/basics/installation.html>.
# 2. You should also add this entry to your /etc/hosts file:
#    127.0.0.1 amphtml.lndo.site
# 3. Trust the default Lando CA on your machine so you can access amphtml.lando.site without any SSL warnings.
#    See <https://docs.devwithlando.io/config/security.html#ssltls>.
# 4. Run `lando start`.
# 5. You should then be able to access <https://amphtml.lando.site> in your browser.
# 6. If using the Local AMP Chrome Extension, open the popup and configure the Base URL to be https://amphtml.lando.site/
#
# Now instead of running `gulp` commands directly, you instead run `lando gulp`. Additionally, some of the common gulp
# commands have shortcuts, so you can run `lando watch` instead of `lando gulp build --watch`. For a full list of the
# shortcuts run `lando help`.
#
# For details on the file format, see <https://docs.lando.dev/config/lando.html>.
# For more context on this Lando environment for amphtml, see <https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/pull/23213>.
