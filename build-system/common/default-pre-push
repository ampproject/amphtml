# This file contains the default pre-push hook for AMPHTML. To enable it, run:
#     "./build-system/common/enable-git-pre-push.sh"
#
# Note: The checks in this file must not take more than a few seconds to run.
# Time consuming checks that call amp build, or run all the tests are
# forbidden. If you'd like to add something like that to your pre-push, do so
# by directly editing .git/hooks/pre-push instead of editing this default hook.
