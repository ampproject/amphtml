# Nailgun runner for AMP's custom closure compiler

The AMP Project uses a custom version of closure compiler available at build-system/runner/dist/runner.jar. The compiler binary is launched several dozen times during the default multi-pass minification compilation (`gulp dist`). In order to speed up compilation, we use `nailgun` (https://github.com/facebook/nailgun) to launch a reusable instance of closure compiler.
