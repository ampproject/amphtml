/**
 * Generates the AMP version number.
 *
 * Version numbers are determined using the following algorithm:
 * - Count the number (<X>) of cherry-picked commits on this branch, including
 *   commits not on the main branch . If this branch only contains new commits
 *   that are not cherry-picked, then <X> is 0).
 * - Find the commit (<C>) before the last cherry-picked commit from the
 *   main branch (if the current branch is the main branch, or otherwise in
 *   its commit history, then the current commit is <C>).
 * - Find the commit time of <C> (<C>.time). Note that commit time might be
 *   different from author time! e.g., commit time might be the time that a PR
 *   was merged into the main branch, or a commit was cherry-picked onto the
 *   branch;
 *   author time is when the original author of the commit ran the "git commit"
 *   command.
 * - The version number is <C>.time.format("YYmmDDHHMM", "UTC") + <X> (the
 *   pseudo-code assumes standard `.strftime` formatting, and <X> gets
 *   zero-padded until it is three digits long).
 *   - The maximum number of cherry-picks in a single branch is 999. More than
 *     that will fail to build. This should never happen.
 *
 * Examples:
 * 1. The version number of a release built from the HEAD commit on the main
 *    branch, where that HEAD commit was committed on April 25, 2020 2:31 PM EDT
 *    would be `2004251831000`.
 *    - EDT is UTC-4, so the hour value changes from EDT's 14 to UTC's 18.
 *    - The last three digits are 000 as this commit is on the main branch.
 *
 * 2. The version number of a release built from a local working branch (e.g.,
 *    on a developer's workstation) that was split off from a main branch commit
 *    from May 6, 2021 10:40 AM PDT and has multiple commits that exist only on
 *    local working branch would be `2105061840000`.
 *    - PDT is UTC-7, so the hour value changes from PDT's 10 to UTC's 17.
 *    - The last three digits are 000 as this commit is on a branch that was
 *      split from the main branch, and does not have any cherry-picked commits.
 *
 * 3. For a release built from a local working branch that was split off from a
 *    main branch commit from November 9, 2021 11:48 PM PST, and then:
 *    - had one commit that was cherry-picked from the main branch,
 *    - followed by two commits that were created directly on the branch, the
 *      last of which was commited on November 23, 2021 6:38 PM PST,
 *    - followed by twelve commits that were cherry-picked from the main branch,
 *      then its version number would be `2111240238012`.
 *    - The latest twelve commits are cherry-picks from the main branch, and the
 *      one before them is not, so our last three digits are set to 012.
 *    - PST is UTC-8, so the hour value changes from PST's 18 to UTC's 2, and
 *      one day is added.
 *
 * The version number can be manually overridden by passing --version_override
 * to the `amp build`/`amp dist` command.
 *
 * @return {string} AMP version number (always 13 digits long)
