## Development on AMP HTML

### Slack and mailing list

Please join our [announcements mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/amphtml-announce). This is a curated, low volume list for announcements about breaking changes and similar issues in AMP.

We discuss implementation issues on [amphtml-discuss@googlegroups.com](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/amphtml-discuss).

For more immediate feedback, [sign up for our Slack](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1wAE8w3K5preZnBkRk-MD1QkX8FmlRDxd_vs4bFSeJlQ/viewform?fbzx=4406980310789882877).

### Great First Issues

We're curating a [list of GitHub "great first issues"](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/labels/Great%20First%20Issues) of small to medium complexity that are great to jump into development on AMP.

If you have any questions, feel free to ask on the issue or join us on [Slack](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1wAE8w3K5preZnBkRk-MD1QkX8FmlRDxd_vs4bFSeJlQ/viewform?fbzx=4406980310789882877)!

### Installation

1. Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org).
2. In the repo directory, run `npm i` command to install the required npm packages.
3. Run `npm i -g gulp` command to install gulp system-wide (on Mac or Linux you may need to prefix this with `sudo`, depending on how Node was installed).
4. Edit your hosts file (`/etc/hosts` on Mac or Linux, `%SystemRoot%\System32\drivers\etc\hosts` on Windows) and map `ads.localhost` and `iframe.localhost` to `127.0.0.1`.
<pre>
  127.0.0.1               ads.localhost iframe.localhost
</pre>

<a id="footnote-1">[1]</a> On Windows, this command must be run as administrator.

#### Saucelabs

Running tests on Sauce Labs requires an account. You can get one by signing up for [Open Sauce](https://saucelabs.com/opensauce/). This will provide you with a user name and access code that you need to add to your `.bashrc` or equivalent like this:

```
export SAUCE_USERNAME=sauce-labs-user-name
export SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY=access-key
```

Also for local testing, download [saucelabs connect](https://docs.saucelabs.com/reference/sauce-connect/) (If you are having trouble, downgrade to 4.3.10) and establish a tunnel by running the `sc` before running tests.

If your pull request contains JS or CSS changes and it does not change the build system, it will be automatically built and tested on [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/ampproject/amphtml/builds). After the travis run completes, the result will be logged to your PR.

If a test flaked on a pull request you can ask a project owner to restart the tests for you. Use [`this.retries(x)`](https://mochajs.org/#retry-tests) as the last resort.

### Manual testing

The below assume you ran `gulp` in a terminal.

#### Examples

The content in the `examples` directory can be reached at: http://localhost:8000/examples/

For each example there are 3 modes:

- `/examples/abc.html` points to prod. This file would not reflect your local changes.
- `/examples/abc.max.html` points to your local unminified AMP. You want to use this during normal dev.
- `/examples/abc.min.html` points to a local minified AMP. This is closer to the prod setup. Only available after running `gulp dist --fortesting`.


#### Document proxy

AMP ships with a local proxy for testing production AMP documents with the local JS version.

For any public AMP document like: http://output.jsbin.com/pegizoq/quiet

You can access is with the local JS at

- normal sources: http://localhost:8000/max/output.jsbin.com/pegizoq/quiet
- minified: http://localhost:8000/min/output.jsbin.com/pegizoq/quiet

When accessing `min` urls make sure you run `gulp dist` with the `--fortesting`
flag so that we do not strip out the localhost code paths. (We do some
code elimination to trim down the file size for the file we deploy to production)

If the origin resource is on HTTPS, the URLs are http://localhost:8000/max/s/output.jsbin.com/pegizoq/quiet and http://localhost:8000/min/s/output.jsbin.com/pegizoq/quiet


#### A4A envelope

AMP ships with a local A4A envelope for testing local and production AMP documents with the local JS version.

A4A can be run either of these two modes:

1. Friendly iframe mode: http://localhost:8000/a4a/...
2. 3p iframe mode: http://localhost:8000/a4a-3p/...

The following forms are supported:

- local document: http://localhost:8000/a4a[-3p]/examples/animations.amp.max.html
- proxied document with normal sources: http://localhost:8000/a4a[-3p]/max/output.jsbin.com/pegizoq/quiet
- proxied document with minified sources: http://localhost:8000/a4a[-3p]/min/output.jsbin.com/pegizoq/quiet

When accessing `min` urls make sure you run `gulp dist` with the `--fortesting`
flag so that we do not strip out the localhost code paths. (We do some
code elimination to trim down the file size for the file we deploy to production)

If the origin resource is on HTTPS, the URLs are http://localhost:8000/a4a[-3p]/max/s/output.jsbin.com/pegizoq/quiet and http://localhost:8000/a4a[-3p]/min/s/output.jsbin.com/pegizoq/quiet

Notice that all documents are assumed to have a "fake" signature. Thus, this functionality is only available in the
`localDev` mode.

Additionally, the following query parameters can be provided:

- `width` - the width of the `amp-ad` (default "300")
- `height` - the height of the `amp-ad` (default "250")


#### Chrome extension

For testing documents on arbitrary URLs with your current local version of the AMP runtime we created a [Chrome extension](testing/local-amp-chrome-extension/README.md).

#### Deploying AMP on Cloud for testing on devices

For deploying and testing local AMP builds on [HEROKU](https://www.heroku.com/) , please follow the steps outlined in this [document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LOr8SEBEpLkqnFjzTNIZGi2VA8AC8_aKmDVux6co63U/edit?usp=sharing).

Meantime, you can also use our automatic build on Heroku [link](http://amphtml-nightly.herokuapp.com/), which is normally built with latest head on master branch (please allow delay). The first time load is normally slow due to Heroku's free account throttling policy.

To correctly get ads and third party working when testing on hosted services
you will need set the `AMP_TESTING_HOST` environment variable. (On heroku this
is done through
`heroku config:set AMP_TESTING_HOST=my-heroku-subdomain.herokuapp.com`)

## Repository Layout

## Supported browsers

In general we support the 2 latest versions of major browsers like Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari and Opera. We support desktop, phone, tablet and the web view version of these respective browsers.

Beyond that the core AMP library and builtin elements should aim for very wide browser support and we accept fixes for all browsers with market share greater than 1 percent.

In particular, we try to maintain "it might not be perfect but isn't broken"-support for the Android 4.0 system browser and Chrome 28+ on phones.

We also recommend scanning the [spec](spec/). The non-element part should help understand some of the design aspects.
