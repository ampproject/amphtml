## Development on AMP HTML

### Mailing list

We discuss implementation issues on [amphtml-discuss@googlegroups.com](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/amphtml-discuss).

### Installation

1. `npm i`
2. `edit /etc/hosts` and map `ads.localhost` and `iframe.localhost` to `127.0.0.1`:
<pre>
  127.0.0.1               ads.localhost iframe.localhost
</pre>

| `gulp minify`                 | Builds production binaries.                                           |
| `gulp lint`                   | Validates against Google Closure Linter.                              |
| `gulp build`                  | Builds the AMP library.                                               |
| `gulp clean`                  | Removes build output.                                                 |

To fix issues with Safari test runner launching multiple instances of the test, run:
<pre>
  defaults write com.apple.Safari ApplePersistenceIgnoreState YES
</pre>

### Manual testing

For testing documents on arbitrary URLs with your current local version of the AMP runtime we created a [Chrome extension](testing/local-amp-chrome-extension/README.md).

## Repository Layout
<pre>
  3p/             - Implementation of third party sandbox iframes.
  ads/            - Modules implementing specific ad networks used in <amp-ad>

                    gets deployed to cdn.ampproject.org.
  dist.3p/        - (generated) JS binaries and HTML files for 3p embeds and ads.
                    This is what gets deployed to 3p.ampproject.net.

  testing/        - testing infrastructure
</pre>

## Supported browsers

In general we support the 2 latest versions of major browsers like Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari and Opera. We support desktop, phone, tablet and the web view version of these respective browsers.

Beyond that the core AMP library and builtin elements should aim for very wide browser support and we accept fixes for all browsers with market share greater than 1 percent.

In particular, we try to maintain "it might not be perfect but isn't broken"-support for the Android 4.0 system browser and Chrome 28+ on phones.

## Eng docs

- [Life of an AMP *](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WdNj3qNFDmtI--c2PqyRYrPrxSg2a-93z5iX0SzoQS0/edit#)
- [AMP Layout system](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YjFk_B6r97CCaQJf2nXRVuBOuNi_3Fn87Zyf1U7Xoz4/edit)

We also recommend scanning the [spec](spec/). The non-element part should help understand some of the design aspects.
