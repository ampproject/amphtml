## Development on AMP HTML

### Slack and mailing list

Please join our [announcements mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/amphtml-announce). This is a curated, low volume list for announcements about breaking changes and similar issues in AMP.

We discuss implementation issues on [amphtml-discuss@googlegroups.com](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/amphtml-discuss).

For more immediate feedback, [sign up for our Slack](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1wAE8w3K5preZnBkRk-MD1QkX8FmlRDxd_vs4bFSeJlQ/viewform?fbzx=4406980310789882877).

### Starter issues

We're curating a [list of GitHub "starter issues"](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Astarter) of small to medium complexity that are great to jump into development on AMP.

If you have any questions, feel free to ask on the issue or join us on [Slack](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1wAE8w3K5preZnBkRk-MD1QkX8FmlRDxd_vs4bFSeJlQ/viewform?fbzx=4406980310789882877)!

### Installation

1. Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org).
2. In the repo directory, run `npm i` command to install the required npm packages.
3. run `sudo npm i -g gulp` command to install gulp in your local bin folder ('/usr/local/bin/' on Mac).
4. `edit /etc/hosts` and map `ads.localhost` and `iframe.localhost` to `127.0.0.1`.
<pre>
  127.0.0.1               ads.localhost iframe.localhost
</pre>

### Build & Test

| Command                       | Description                                                           |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |

#### Saucelabs

Running tests on Sauce Labs requires an account. You can get one by signing up for [Open Sauce](https://saucelabs.com/opensauce/). This will provide you with a user name and access code that you need to add to your `.bashrc` or equivalent like this:

```
export SAUCE_USERNAME=sauce-labs-user-name
export SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY=access-key
```

Also for local testing, download [saucelabs connect](https://docs.saucelabs.com/reference/sauce-connect/) (If you are having trouble, downgrade to 4.3.10) and establish a tunnel by running the `sc` before running tests.

If your pull request contains JS or CSS changes and it does not change the build system, it will be automatically built and tested on [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/ampproject/amphtml/builds). After the travis run completes, the result will be logged to your PR.

If a test flaked on a pull request you can ask a project owner to restart the tests for you.

### Manual testing

#### Examples

The content in the `examples` directory can be reached at: http://localhost:8000/examples.build/

For each example there are 3 files:

- Original name: This points to prod. This file would not reflect your local changes.
- `.max.html` points to your local unminified AMP. You want to use this during normal dev.
- `.min.html` points to a local minified AMP. This is closer to the prod setup. Only available after running `gulp dist`.


#### Document proxy

AMP ships with a local proxy for testing production AMP documents with the local JS version.

For any public AMP document like: http://output.jsbin.com/pegizoq/quiet

You can access is with the local JS at

- normal sources: http://localhost:8000/max/output.jsbin.com/pegizoq/quiet
- minified: http://localhost:8000/min/output.jsbin.com/pegizoq/quiet

If the origin resource is on HTTPS, the URLs are http://localhost:8000/max/s/output.jsbin.com/pegizoq/quiet and http://localhost:8000/min/s/output.jsbin.com/pegizoq/quiet

#### Chrome extension

For testing documents on arbitrary URLs with your current local version of the AMP runtime we created a [Chrome extension](testing/local-amp-chrome-extension/README.md).

#### Deploying AMP on Cloud for testing on devices

For deploying and testing local AMP builds on [HEROKU](https://www.heroku.com/) , please follow the steps outlined in this [document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LOr8SEBEpLkqnFjzTNIZGi2VA8AC8_aKmDVux6co63U/edit?usp=sharing).

## Supported browsers

In general we support the 2 latest versions of major browsers like Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari and Opera. We support desktop, phone, tablet and the web view version of these respective browsers.

Beyond that the core AMP library and builtin elements should aim for very wide browser support and we accept fixes for all browsers with market share greater than 1 percent.

In particular, we try to maintain "it might not be perfect but isn't broken"-support for the Android 4.0 system browser and Chrome 28+ on phones.

## Eng docs

- [Life of an AMP *](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WdNj3qNFDmtI--c2PqyRYrPrxSg2a-93z5iX0SzoQS0/edit#)
- [AMP Layout system](spec/amp-html-layout.md)

We also recommend scanning the [spec](spec/). The non-element part should help understand some of the design aspects.
