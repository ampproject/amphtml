        These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing
        mission, to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new
        civilizations, to boldly go where no one has gone before. We need to
        neutralize the homing signal. Each unit has total environmental control,
        gravity, temperature, atmosphere, light, in a protective field. Sensors
        show energy readings in your area. We had a forced chamber explosion in
        the resonator coil. Field strength has increased by 3,000 percent.

        Shields up. I recommend we transfer power to phasers and arm the photon
        torpedoes. Something strange on the detector circuit. The weapons must
        have disrupted our communicators. You saw something as tasty as meat,
        but inorganically materialized out of patterns used by our transporters.
        Captain, the most elementary and valuable statement in science, the
        beginning of wisdom, is 'I do not know.' All transporters off.

        Communication is not possible. The shuttle has no power. Using the
        gravitational pull of a star to slingshot back in time? We are going to
        Starbase Montgomery for Engineering consultations prompted by minor
        read-out anomalies. Probes have recorded unusual levels of geological
        activity in all five planetary systems. Assemble a team. Look at records
        of the Drema quadrant. Would these scans detect artificial transmissions
        as well as natural signals?

        Deflector power at maximum. Energy discharge in six seconds. Warp
        reactor core primary coolant failure. Fluctuate phaser resonance
        frequencies. Resistance is futile. Recommend we adjust shield harmonics
        to the upper EM band when proceeding. These appear to be some kind of
        power-wave-guide conduits which allow them to work collectively as they
        perform ship functions. Increase deflector modulation to upper frequency
        band.

        Exceeding reaction chamber thermal limit. We have begun power-supply
        calibration. Force fields have been established on all turbo lifts and
        crawlways. Computer, run a level-two diagnostic on warp-drive systems.
        Antimatter containment positive. Warp drive within normal parameters. I
        read an ion trail characteristic of a freighter escape pod. The bomb had
        a molecular-decay detonator. Detecting some unusual fluctuations in
        subspace frequencies.

        Sensors indicate human life forms 30 meters below the planet's surface.
        Stellar flares are increasing in magnitude and frequency. Set course for
        Rhomboid Dronegar 006, warp seven. There's no evidence of an advanced
        communication network. Total guidance system failure, with less than 24
        hours' reserve power. Shield effectiveness has been reduced 12 percent.
        We have covered the area in a spherical pattern which a ship without
        warp drive could cross in the given time.

        It indicates a synchronic distortion in the areas emanating triolic
        waves. The cerebellum, the cerebral cortex, the brain stem, the entire
        nervous system has been depleted of electrochemical energy. Any device
        like that would produce high levels of triolic waves. These walls have
        undergone some kind of selective molecular polarization. I haven't
        determined if our phaser energy can generate a stable field. We could
        alter the photons with phase discriminators.
