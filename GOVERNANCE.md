# AMP Project open source governance

This document describes the governance model for the AMP open source project, and in particular the [AMP HTML GitHub project](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml).

Our governance model is as follows:

* There is a single [Tech Lead](#list-of-core-committers), who will have the final say on all decisions regarding technical direction.
* The Tech Lead directs the [Core Committers](#list-of-core-committers), whose members include the Tech Lead and those who have been appointed by the Tech Lead as Core Committers.
* In the event the Tech Lead is unable to perform their duty, or abdicates, the Core Committers can select a new Tech Lead from amongst themselves.
* In the unlikely event that there are no more Core Committers, Google Inc. will appoint a new Tech Lead.
* Significant feature development and changes to AMP require following the ["Intent to implement"](./CONTRIBUTING.md#feature-development) process including approval from the Tech Lead and one Core Committer.
* Before contributions can be merged into the AMP Project approval must be given by an [Owner and a Core Committer](./contributing/owners-and-committers.md)
